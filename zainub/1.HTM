Nomadic refers to the migration of the Ismaili and Gujerati communityfrom India to Africa and to the Western world.<P>I define architecture in the broadest terms to include notonly built structuresbut also the total way in which a culture uses time and space in conceptualizingits social existence. This time and space articulation or chronotope of aspecific culture addresses how that culture communicates and interacts withitself, and also the wider social and natural world.<P align=right><A href="2.html">>>>>></A></blockquote></body></html>
