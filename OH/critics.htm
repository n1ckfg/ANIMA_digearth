Hockenhull confirms that estimation with his latest feature, an unusual documentary that is as multi-layered, mind altering, and non-traditional as its subject matter: the great English novelist, essayist, iconoclast, social prophet, and proponent of psychedelic drugs, Aldous Huxley...The fascinating, exasperating, mescaline-rush result: a Brave New Look at the author of Brave New World -- and a much needed meditative look back, as we near the end of the millennium, at one of the century's most modern thinkers." </P><H5>Pacific Cinematheque Program Notes -1997- </H5><P><HR></P><P>"Endlessly fascinating. It is, in fact, a brave new work. A brave next wave. <BR>Visually entrancing and sparklingly innovative, Aldous Huxley: The Gravity of Light, is a post-Godardian meeting of mind, fact and light. Huxley, the visionary, would've tripped out." </P><H5>- Peter Wintonick, Co-Producer/Co-Director, <BR>"Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media". </H5><P><HR></P><P>"Hockenhull's simultaneously thoughtful and carefully conceived approach to the subject has made for a kind of documentary I would not hesitate to compare with the works of <B>Trinh T. Minh-ha</B> in form and self-reflexivity and <B>Derek Jarman</B> in style and composition. He has clearly defined a number of forms with which he expresses Huxley's philosophy and thought, and successfully plays with - and off of - film forms, stylistics and audience expectations. Complex counterpoint and junctures in the formal aspects of the film are fused with a combination of self-reflexive dramatic elements and intelligent, innovative use of archival footage, as well as inspired moments of computer-rendered 3D animation. Hockenhull's approach to this "hybrid" form of cinema manages to aggressively question our presumptions and preconceptions around the current Zeitgeist while simultaneously exploring the knowledge and impact of one of the twentieth century's greatest minds." </P><H5>Alex Mackenzie, Curator/Programmer, Edison Electric Gallery of Moving Images.</H5><P><HR></P><P>"...the two most compelling indie features from our region are Canadian imports- the Vancouver, B.C. produced <I>Aldous Huxley: the Gravity of Light</I> (7 pm Wednesday, Nov. 6) and <I>Cat Swallows Parakeet and Speaks!</I> (7pm Friday November 8) ...<BR>Taking a similar track to the one filmmaker<B> Errol Morris</B> used in delineating physicist Stephen Hawking's life and theories with <I>A Brief History of Time</I>, Oliver Hockenhull juxtaposes the life of author and social critic Aldous Huxley (Brave New World) with computer animation, archival footage and visual poetry to create essays on a prophetic visionary and the toll of unrelenting progress." </P><H5>Dale E. Basye, Willamette Week - Portland</H5><P><HR></P><P>"As the next millennium approaches, Aldous Huxley's social prophecies and cultural criticisms take on a renewed resonance...a fascinating reading of Huxley's oeuvre...Hockenhull traces the parallel paths of Huxley's own life (including his experimentation with LSD and mescaline) and the movement of history in a truly iconoclastic film essay." </P><H5>The 23 rd Annual Northwest Film and Video Festival Guide, <BR>The Best of the Northwest Film Festival, Portland Art Museum, Oregon.</H5><P><HR></P><P>"Like Chomsky, Aldous Huxley is an ideal film subject-articulate, challenging, charismatic-and Hockenhull has unearthed two riveting interviews with him from the CBC and the BBC to anchor the film. Using techniques ranging from computer animation to drama, the film expands on Huxley's wide-ranging and provocative ideas. The illustrations and allusions are sometimes subtle, sometimes humorous, sometimes ominous. In the process, the film playfully works to evolve the definition of documentary, gripping the intellect of the audience and giving it a good shaking." </P><H5>Mark Achbar, Co-Director, Co-Producer <BR>"Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media"</H5><P><HR></P><P>"Daring and deeply personal look at the British essayist/novelist/prophet...inspired." </P><H5>Lee Bacchus, The Province, Vancouver.</H5><P><HR></P><P>"The filmmaker leavens tough observations with wry comedy and offbeat dissociative effects: at various points, he has modern actors play scenes from old Huxley novels, and African Canadian David Nandi Odhiambo sometimes stands in for Huxley and sometimes for Hockenhull...The interviews taken from CBC and BBC clips (thanks to the permission of the writer's widow, Laura Huxley, still active at 82) remained some of the few constants as the director fashioned different versions of the film. Ultimately, he also included footage of a humorous talk given by Huxley specialist Jean Houston. </P><H5>- Ken Eisner, The Georgia Straight, Vancouver.</H5><P><HR></P><H5>And Yes A Negative View</H5><P>The work received a highly negative review written by a Mr. A. Lackey of Edmonton, Alberta. Writing in the October '97 issue of an Edmonton Magazine titled <U>On Screen</U> Mr. Lackey describes the film as "the Glen or Glenda? of all egghead films" not knowing I guess, that to be honoured as the clown/crown of transgendered intellectual perversity is praise indeed. I would not feel that my supper was paid for, that I had performed my role of an artist with integrity, if the work did not annoy and provoke at least a few.- O.H. </P><P><HR></P></BODY></HTML>
