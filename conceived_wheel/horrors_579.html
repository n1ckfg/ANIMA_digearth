<p> <br> <br> Enjoying the horror of
	your schizophrenia as if it were a divine sort of fashion, a manner of
	post-modern superiority over those who still have the ability to recall, to
	emote.   One day you will wake up frozen in your self and have no where to
	go for everything will appear as iced too.  <br> <br> The games of
	seductions will appear thoroughly emptied,  it will be the expanse of your
	own falling into <A HREF="church_571.html"><A
	HREF="abstracts_750.html">an abyss</A></A>.  You may come out free
	or without an essence of self.<br> <br> A hungry ghost, <A
