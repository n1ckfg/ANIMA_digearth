Everything a	digression from the flat wall of meaning nothing. Can't imagine the still	reliance on story.  A mouse cage mill, a running commentary exercising the	imagined bodies of persona and the blinding blips of assorted intoxications.	<br> <br> Buying so many pages of brain fever on hard paper.  A book is as	reassuring as a building, it's language as a shelter, a veritable skelton to	uphold the flesh of our individual mortality.  <br> <br> Electronic text	wavers as a nervous impulse from the writer to the	reader.<p>		<UL>: -<A	HREF="wheel_853.html">wheel</A>-<A	HREF="inland_633.html">inland</A>-<A	HREF="dry_sugar_804.html">dry sugar</A>-<A	HREF="safe_sex_802.html">safe sex</A>-<A	HREF="further_deceits_378.html">further deceits</A></UL><p><p>
