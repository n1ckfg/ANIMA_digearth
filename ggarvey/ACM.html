In doing so the user/sinnercan experience the ectasy of forgiveness in a Manicheansystem governed by the binary logic of good and evil wherequilt, shame, sin, and salvation, are all input variables thatdetermine the catechism of output: namely how many HailMarys and Our Fathers must be said for redemption.<HR><ul><H3>Recent Work</H3><li><A HREF="#label1">The Automatic Confession Machine at Ars Electronica</A><li><A HREF="#label3">The Automatic Confession Machine reported by CTT</A><li><A HREF="http://www.lightfactory.org/artists.html">Go to Confession</A><li><a href="GBframe2.html" target="_top"><img align=center border=0 width=40 height=50 src="GBicon.gif">GENDERBENDER</a></ul><HR></Body><A NAME="label1">Landesmuseum, Linz, Austria - 1994</A><HR><Img Src="AECACM.jpg" Align=middle><HR><A NAME="label3">Photo of Image du Futur'94 from Newsletter of ITT Japan </A><HR><Img Src="ACMJAP.jpg" Align=middle><Center><PRE></PRE><A HREF="Portraits.html">Computer Portraits</A><br><A HREF="http://www.lightfactory.org/garvey/welcome.html">Go to Confession</A><A HREF="GGWebPage1.html">Go to Greg Garvey's Home Page</A><HR></Center><HTML/>
