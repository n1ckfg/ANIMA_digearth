The SMART STALL isconceived as an ‘immersive’ interactive theatrical experience,having a well defined beginning, middle and end. Takinginspiration from Antonin Artaud’s ‘Theatre of Cruelty’ theuser’s motion triggers ‘orders’ and ‘instructions’ from anabusive semi-intelligent agent suffering from multiplepersonality disorder. In homage to Duchamp’s avatar  - R. Mutt - this installationlooks like a public toilet stall but actually is atelecommunications terminal. Non functioning bathroom toiletstalls were constructed at the Conference Center and theContemporary Art Center in New Orleans. Each was equippedwith a digital white board which digitized handwrittengraffiti and transmitted it via a T3 line to the remote stallwhere the message was projected. Infrared motion detectorsand magnet switches trigger audible instructions.Like the Automatic Confession Machine, THE SMART STALL,while making use of technology questions our infatuation withit. THE SMART STALL challenges the aims of ubiquitouscomputing. It calls into question the authority of technology bythe medium of immersive theatrical form where participationin this virtual stage requires the willing suspension ofdisbelief as the compliant user is ordered about by a virtualauthoritarian agent. As Brenda Laurel has noted the potentialof computers is “not in its ability to perform calculations butin its capacity to represent action in which humans couldparticipate.”<HR></Body><A HREF="SMARTS.jpg"><Img Src="SMARTS.jpg" Align=top>THE SMART STALL</A><HR><A HREF="ACM.html"><Img Src="AECACMicon.JPG" Align=top></A><H2><A HREF="ACM.html">The Automatic Confession Machine</A><HR><A HREF="Portraits.html"><Img Src="MMicon.jpg" Align=middle></A><A HREF="Portraits.html">Computer Portraits</A>	<HR><Center><H3><A HREF="http://www-fofa.concordia.ca">Go to the Faculty of Fine Arts Home Page</A></H3><br><H3><A HREF="http://www-fofa.concordia.ca/DART/index.html">Go to the Design Art Home Page</A></Center></H3><HTML/>
