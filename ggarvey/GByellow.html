GENDERBENDER allows a user to self-administer a gender test in order to construct a personalgender profile of 20 masculine, feminine or neutral traits. TheBSRI of 1974 is a self-administered 60-item questionnaire, containing a Masculinity scale and a Femininity Scale with 20 neutral items as filler. It is a kind of time capsule givinginsight into how notions of gender are mutable. Whenpersonality traits become reduced to and locked in algorithmicdescriptions those chosen traits almost inevitably reflect thebiases and clichés of what is considered 'normal.' The Morph-o-meter and the Tile-o-matic give instant feedbackon whether masculine or feminine characteristics predominatein the user's personality by morphing towards a identifiablymale or female visual representation. The Tile-o-matic willreveal each user's video image tile by tile for each yesresponse. Based on the user's responses the "ComputerPsychologist" will display the message  "You are a man!" or"You are a woman!" or "You are androgynous!" Future releaseswill introduce a two player internet version and the creationof an online avatar that reflects the gender profile that theuser gives it. This avatar can act as a gendered knowbot thatwill visit chat groups, perform searches and report back to it'smaster and perhaps provide links for actual meat and fleshencounters. </a></td><td align=middle><a href="GBscreen.html" target="_top"><img border=5 width=101 height=115 src="GBrot.gif"><h5>PLAY GENDERBENDER NOW!</h5></a></td></tr><td align=middle><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave" target="_top"><img  src="get_shockwave.gif"><h5>Need Shockwave?</h5></a></td></tr></table></body></html>
