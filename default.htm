This event is a challenge to understand the mutations createdby technology and its effects on biovolution. With DEFT 2000, DigitaleARTh envisions a city wide look ahead to the third millenium through thelens of digital art and biotechnology. How is our world being altered bydevelopments in the lifesciences? What is the role of the artists withinthe interplay of science and society?<P><center><img src="light1.jpg"></center><P>Zero Degree Monstrosity: Biotech/Immortality/Evolution<P>On the threshold of the new millennium, the notion of the human body restsupon an image that is intrinsically prescriptive: a normally formed humanis Zero Degree Monstrosity (ZDM). ZDM is the ground zero of an assumedhumanity which has never been met but is continually repromised as aheavenly immortality bounded tight in a world thoroughly calculated,precise, and ideal. Technological changes are causing alterations in thenature of our senses, our environment and ultimately our corporeality.<P>The human, being so profoundly a social creature is most dependent uponits placement with the cultural codes of its society. Digital, genetic,telecommunications, drugs and organ farms, cloning factories, the softwarethat runs the human program, the human machine called civilization are allexperiencing the permanent revolution - foot to the floor technologicalacceleration. Perpetual mutation is the resultant evolutionary grimace.Based upon the achievements of digital information technology,biotechnology and genetic engineering are bringing forth a new definitionof our future selves. The new human being is preselected following assumednorms: is this an ideal or a monster? <P>The cultural dynamics of ZDM is a distribution of power and capital thatoften erases excess and mutation yet monsters are the primary artifact ofevolution signage. What light does monstrosity throw on immortality andevolution? What is our current conception of what it means to be human?Are we all now monsters of the new world disorder? Will the digitalrevolution be followed by a biological one? <P>DEFT 2000 deploys an interweaving of the theoretical-scholarly andartistic modes of confronting issues. Along with a symposium whichconstitutes the core of Zero Degree Monstrosities: biotech/immortality/evolution, a diverse array of artists, critics and scientists will confrontand deal with the cultural-philosophical, social-political, andmetaphysical issues raised by genetic engineering. It is necessary, atthis juncture in time, that a focused context for discussion is engenderedwhich allows for clarity without simplification and openness without theloss of criticality. <P>Affiliations and Partnerships<P>Zero Degree Monstrosity: Biotech/Immortality/Evolution will attempt tomake this discourse accessible through exhibitions of new media,film/video screenings, lectures and a symposium. DEFT 2000 will provide theumbrella for events including organization and operations, publicity and asymposium. The festival can only have breath with the participation ofaffiliations among art centres, cultural institutions and communityparticipation.We invited you to engage with the theme of the Digital/ ElectronicFestival of Art and Technology by programming events within yourrespective organization during the festival run. DEFT 2000 will provideorganizational support, networking and publicity for the event as a whole.As Digital eARTh is a virtual society, we will require space to exhibitnew media work, offer workshops, screen film/video and showcase guestlectures and presentations.<P>Symposium<P>Zero Degree Monstrosity: Biotech/Immortality/Evolution will be thefocused theme of the symposium. Over the course of three days, DEFT 2000will organize a series of panel discussions and papers addressing keythemes. International speakers will sit alongside local artists, academicsand critics to evaluate the important issues that will permeate the nextmillennium. We plan to pose critical questions and generate debate aboutthe future rather than reevaluate the past.<P><center><img src="bg.jpg"></center><P>Aims and Intentions<P>The intention of DEFT 2000 and Zero Degree Monstrosity: Biotech/Immortality/Evolution is toevaluate the role of art in therealm of biotechnology and to foster an understanding ofart's role as a decisive factor in social transformation. Thechallenges wrought by genetic engineering effect both society and anengaged art practice. DEFT 2000 envisions the examination ofbiotechnology and digital culture in the form of a variety of events,installations, performances, exhibitions, and network projects. Weencourage you to participate in whatever capacity you might envision. Yourcontributions, questions and input are welcome, indeed we anticipate them.DEFT 2000 aims to encompass as many viewpoints as there are participants.The festival is designed to facilitate discussion, broaden awareness andencourage new audiences with respect to the future of biotechnology anddigital culture.<P><AHREF="mailto:rcutler@eciad.bc.ca">contact</A><P>Thanks to The Canada Council for the Arts and External Affairs Canada/Cultural PromotionDivision.<P></table></body></HTML>
