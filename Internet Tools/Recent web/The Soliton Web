                               The Soliton Web                             ------------------- a many-layered Gestaltic series of orderings within orderings complementing                                as the Whole                   --------------------------------------        The concept of the Soltion appears in many different guises. In a      chaotic system, at the point of bifurcation, new components emerge and       are revealed. If we think of each component as a seperate whole unto       itself, we obtain a complex dynamic structure, non-linear in nature,          enjoying negative feedback, and geometrically modeling both a        phase-state snapshot across scale (fractalized composition series       [Group Theory]), and, taking a vertical slice, a model of continuous                              cooperative evolution.     What happens at the boundary or membrane of the Soliton may be the most      important focus for examination. This boundary is chaotic in the sense      that both order and disorder occupy, reside in, the same spacetime at                    the interface between dimensions of scale.      Another significant characteristic of the Soliton is that it contains      an 'infinite' number of sub-components (frequencies) interdependently       relating; and, if only one were to disperse, the entire edi-face, or      wave, would lose cohesion and integrity (identity) and dissipate. They            form, in a sense, a set of basis elements for the Soliton.         Forming larger groups (Group Theory) from the products of simple         (discrete, seperate, non-divisible) groups covers completely all          possible permutations of groups. In the process, we can relate      different dimensions one to the other however we may wish for purposes                                   of scrutiny.         As a parallel, non-linear dynamic systems and structures are the        fundamental constituents and building blocks of Nature; that is a        given-- pattern is basic. But these systems can also model social,         economic and psychological processes both in the macro and micro                                     worlds.        The archaic pictures we still, to a great extent, rely on and with         which we base predictions are linear, Newtonian and mechanistic     apperceptions of how we, living in that absolute and continuous 'time,'         and with a homogeneous and empirical definition of 'space,' give              expression to and understand the dynamics of 'world.'      Does chaos order disorder or does order break down into disorder at a      certain critical level or point? Which came first, the chicken or the                                       egg?       In a totally symmetric system, all dimensions of phase-space (which       ordinarily consists of six, three of position and three of momentum)          are reduced through slices or shells to a single point. From a       topological perspective, considering the theory that speculates the     Universe to be composed of ten dimensions, these six are compacted into      what is called a ball. At infinite density, maximum compactification,     this ball can be imagined to be a single point, dimensionless until the               tendency towards chaotic behavior effects asymmetry.       This spontaneous symmetry breaking categorizes previously unrelated       phenomena by affinity, predisposition and creative self-organizing.         This hidden ball may very well be the well-spring of all that is        manifest, including the infinitely complex creature-- human being.                       ------------------------------------     Infinity contains, as necessary for existence, the sub-idea of density.        Density allows us to arrange infinity like a composition series of      fractals (loosely, a scaled hierarchy of self-contained, non-divisible      and nested wholes, each a recategorization of the elements of the one        'above' it, yet maintaining the identity integrity -- a series of         overlaying homomorphic images). This gives it a spacio-temporal                                 characteristic.          At the sound-to-noise ratio of S/0, all phase-space points of       information merge into one. This 'ONE' is only such if we ignore the        'holes' of noise contained throughout (like the irrational numbers     scattered through the reals); likewise these 'holes' contain signals or      forms of pure sound. This is a composition series construction, across                 scale, of 'quantumly' differentiable dimensions.     But herein lies the necessary paradox: taking as our model -- sphere --        its surface acts as the boundary or envelope of an interior double        helix touching this surface at both poles. Because of this we can         entertain expressions such as, "I became the whole Universe," as      opposed to, "I was dissolved in the Universe." These are complementary                                 points of view.       As a model for growth and creativity, and because of these mutually       exclusive shifting complementarities, we 'move,' consciousness-wise,      from unity through form/other to integration; Or, from Self to self to                                    Self/self.          This represents the emergence of the dimensionless ball to its       interface with external environment beyond its boundary (creation of      subject/object dichotomy), to the identification with this boundary as      the surface (chaotic interface) of the sphere which contains the ball.        As the end result of this process, the boundary, border, membrane     transforms its definition and intent from static 3-D barrier to living,      dynamic, four-dimensional relationship, the very beginning and end of                         time and infinity as 'now-here.'         At zero density the self has no substance or form. In the third       dimension there is a sense of self and of other; there are definite      boundaries of which we can be and usually are aware. But at 'infinite       density' there is a breakthrough to a sense of self defined by this      mutual blending of 'self' and 'other' on one level and an awareness of     being a 'dividual' transformed and seamlessly connected to the whole on      another. Global topological properties or features common to the whole        induce, foster a mapping to the kernel, the singularity, from the             overall group-complexity. This is a non-linear Soliton.--------------------------------------                            [Prisms_of_the_Mind]                                      --------------------------------------         But what does 'infinite density' mean in this context? It could     represent the mapping between self and other; so complete that there is     no 'discernable' boundary. Or, by compactification (the finite covering       by a set of open [closed] point-sets contained in the topology), the          six dimensional ball as symbol of some unformed self loses all             specificity and becomes a collective 'point' of or in a                         four-dimensional psychic field.         Why is the idea 'density' so important here? When I think of the        density of something I imagine the closeness of seperate geometric      points. At infinite density the points are squeezed together until the     possibility that there may have been holes lurking (local neighborhoods     are not allowed) in the respective space is eliminated; as is any sense     or definition of seperateness. If this space is a phase-space, then the      melding of all content/border will embody the life of the system under                      examination, dynamically apprehended.       Furthermore, what does it mean for a whole of a life, in relation to      its parts, to be a dimensionless point of 4-D phase-space? Statically,      it means little to nothing. But, as a dynamic, this life is expandable      to the further reaches of its potential limited only by the demands of         non-linearity. Without the inherent tendency for asymmetry, all       naturally occurring systems, and some not so natural, would not and         could not be. In the act of asymmetry, we have the generator of                                   phase-space.                       ------------------------------------        A topological ball has, at least, one significant aspect which is     counter intuitive-- a ball, in topology, has no surface. It consists of       simply-connected points comprising the interior of a sphere, but not                    the surface or any of the boundary points.         Imagining a solid ball without a surface is not possible, for me      anyhow. What we have to do in such cases is to bring in 'set theory.'        Set theory possesses the tools for defining, by the use of boolean        operations, whether or not a particular set of points lies in the               interior, surface, or exterior of a specific solid.      The interior of a simply-connected open curve is the set of all points        which make it up, excluding the two endpoints which represent the     boundary. A closed curve, therefore, has no boundary points. Similarly,       with the closed connected surface of a sphere, there is no boundary.       The surface is the boundary of the ball; a two dimensional creature     demanding three dimensions to define itself topologically. This surface        stands for the particular solution of a system of four dimensional     differential equations describing and depicting the state of this phase      space in time. As such it generates the interior of the fourth from a      singular point of view. And, from the subsequent 4-D 'boundary,' both      interiors (third and fourth) are 'seen' to merge; or, equivalently, it      might be said that they create this chaotic boundary ('boundary' here                  once again as symbolic of the notion 'self').      This kind of situation is clear enough when we bring the argument down      a notch. That is, the interior of a delimited three dimensional object      is also the infinite set of 2-D discs (again, a 'disc' does not exist           topologically unless it contains a neighborhood ball, which      necessitates 3-D) that 'make it up' (any one of which is sufficient to      generate that interior); their interiors, that of the solid object and              the set of discs, 'merge' and interpenetrate, becoming                                indistinguishable.      Identification with this extended domain necessarily and by definition      localizes three dimensional solids allowing them to be considered only                               as surface or form.     In other words, from this point of view, three-dimensionality itself is      'seen' objectively. As the fourth dimension is one of time, the vector         normal, or orthogonal, to the third dimension corresponds to the       integration of the interior ball with time point-sets, the domain of                              the fourth dimension.      The solid 3-D object, now viewed only as form, takes on substance and      meaning by virtue of its 'global' properties, while yet maintaining a     'local' identity peculiar to its uniqueness in time and space. It is as     though the object is a nondetachable aspect of the foreground against a           background [a 'background' that penetrates and vitalizes the       'foreground'] of universal geometric features, and by 'geometric' we       mean 'invariant,' defining,-- the kernel. These local properties are       now understood in terms of the fourth dimension, through this lens,                     orientation across scale being complete.                       ------------------------------------      What does all this have to do with the soliton dynamic, one might ask?        A soliton wave resists dispersive disequilibrium, this asymmetric       proclivity to break into individual frequency constitutents, through      internal negative feedback and surface tension. Instead of considering     it in terms of these interactive and interdependent components, we need      to look at it through a collective lens as a single integrated entity.       For there to be growth, however, there must be this asymmetric urge         towards a break-up of existing conditions, the essential kernel      remaining intact through the transition, resolving to a reorganization       and reconfiguration more complex and yet simpler than before, pruned      and strengthened, invigorated, quickly regaining a soliton dynamic and                                      form.       With organics these two processes, disintegration and reintegration,       happen 'almost' simultaneously and continuously, asymmetry being the          engine and generator, symmetry responding to coalesce and give        intelligible and cohesive shape and meaning, Disorder/Order at the                                     border.     If we take the collective to be represented by the third dimension, and       the dynamic of the whole by the fourth, we have a fairly reasonable          model of the Web. A four-dimensional hypersurface, internally      interdependent and self-organizing, each component of which essential     at any given moment in time, yet subject to asymmetric spurts of growth         and reorganization to a new and more complex form. A network of      networks, pattern being basic, each network emulating a soliton wave,      self-similar across varying scales, interconnected, enjoying negative        feedback and undergoing positive amplification, symmetry breaking,     growth and reformation, this is the Web of elements, a spider's web, as      'seen' from the perspective of an organic whole, and defined in terms                      of a 'four-dimensional hypersurface.'      The Web is not just an assemblage of linked objects located at myriad      points on the Net, it's a true worldwide community of in-dividuals, a                                   Soliton Web.                     -----------------------------------     As an aside, I find it interesting how the formatting accentuated the     last word(s) of each paragraph, and the affect that thread has as a     whole unto itself.        -------------------------------------------------------------      Center Stage [TABLE] || [Top of Page] || Center Stage [NON-TABLE]        -------------------------------------------------------------
