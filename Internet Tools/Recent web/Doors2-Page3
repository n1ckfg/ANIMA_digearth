There are three possible strategies, and they     apply to all forms of invasion or attempted seduction.     The first strategy is to lie back and enjoy it. We see this in the     popular arts of recent times. An entropic dystopia is envisioned,     an American homeland fouled by technological detritus, haunted by     robots and cyborgs. Every interior is exposed to the exterior     world, its commerce and its sign system. Spotlights from an     airship advertising emigration to the Off-World pierce through the     skylight of the Bradbury Building. There is no safe home: a     replicant may suddenly smash his head through the wall at you:     Time to Die (19).     Techno-despair is fun. Alienation has a glamorous new uniform, and     everybody is wearing it: sci-fi movies, cyberpunk fiction, funky     philosophers, and computer magazines with attitude. It confirms     the view that the purpose of art is to reconcile us to the     inevitable by accustoming us to the intolerable.     The second strategy against the home's invasion is to strengthen     the walls, reinforce the dyke, lock up your daughters. Market     researchers call it cocooning. An extreme instance would be the     Amish, the Pennsylvanian Anabaptists, who in 1909 banned the phone     from the home--as they have since banned radio and TV, as well as     new technology like electricity and the internal combustion     engine: this protects the home from external spiritual pollutants     and reinforces the sacred separate identity of the community (20).     Usually, however, new technology is slyly admitted, like a whore,     but only if heavily disguised. A particularly British form of     technophobic kitsch hides the phone inside a duck, which quacks     rather than rings, and forces the TV to ply its shameful trade     behind the shutters of a mock-antique cabinet.     Although early Apple users showed an ominous taste for bizarre     letter fonts, computer hardware has largely escaped kitsch. But     software constantly presents itself as metaphor--appears, that is,     in disguise. The metaphor of the physical home is conjured to     reassure the user. No matter what other cards and stacks you have,     says the Hypercard instruction book, you always have home (21).     And of course the new Magic-Cap and eWorld online systems use as     their operating metaphor the toytown topography deplored by John     Thackara (22).     The problem with using a familiar metaphor to represent unfamiliar     situations, as the Modern Movement designers and their     nineteenth-century precursors realised, is that it is at least     partly a lie (23). And the practical (rather than moral) defect of     a lie is that, when situations change, new lies must be added to     sustain the illusion. But the greater the number of lies, the more     difficult it is to make them cohere. In a rapidly changing     environment, then, the disguise or metaphor eventually collapses     through incoherence.     This introduces the third and last strategic response to the     invasion of the home: to let the walls fall, but build new ones     further out, and learn to feel at home in a broader world. Like     Mother, early architectural Modernism argued that in the long run     it is wiser to tell the truth. It believed that the     twentieth-century home and city, the technology which builds them,     and the lifestyles they accommodate, change constantly and     irresistibly. So it is better to dump the old classical language     of structural form, based on stone construction, as well as the     hierarchical patterns of bourgeois living, and to devise a totally     new and flexible language whose forms neither conceal nor     arbitrarily represent each new condition, but inherently reflect     it.     A central element of this Modernist project seemed to be war     against the home: Le Corbusier famously defined the house as a     machine for living in (24). The home was to be destroyed because     collective lifestyles, being tested in revolutionary Russia, and     the new technologies of electricity and glass, would together soon     evict man from it. But home was not to be abolished, only replaced     by a new Home of Man (25) which would welcome the machine.     Plate-glass architecture would not dissolve the dualisms which     formerly separated private from public, inside from out, selfhood     from otherhood. But it would redraw them more lightly, and further     out. Man would inhabit a wider, windswept, more transparent home.     This is echoed in the current dream of the universal, networked     community. The rhetoric of electronic utopianism is Arcadian, and     derives from Shakespeare filtered through Jefferson, Thoreau and     Twain (26). It uses terms which glorify rootlessness: the     informatic badlands, cybercowboys, telematic nomads and so on. But     settlement is never far behind: Howard Rheingold's book, The     Virtual Community, is subtitled Homesteading on the Electronic     Frontier (27).     T h e Ê V i e w Ê O u t     What shall we see when we look through the open windows of our     electronic homestead? Most predictions are that we shall see     luminous representations of data--however sophisticated and     complex. This view even informs imaginative fiction: William     Gibson's Neuromancer famously defines cyberspace as a consensual     hallucination ... A graphic representation of data abstracted from     the banks of every computer in the human system [my emphasis]     (28). This definition reflects a widespread view that mental     activity is primarily about the reception, decoding, evaluation,     transformation and output of information, and that the main     purpose of new electronic technologies is to make information     handling more powerful, efficient, vivid, sexy, and so on. I think     this view is mistaken.     An episode of architectural history may show what I mean. The     architecture critic Martin Pawley recently described the Gothic     cathedral as an archetype of information architecture (29). Its     structural system relieves the building's external skin of     load-bearing duties, which allows the walls to take on an     informational function: most of the cathedral's skin can comprise     vast (and vastly expensive) backlit glass screens. The     screens--mosaics of coloured glass pixels--display images, icons     and alphabetic strings, which together the user reads to learn the     complex codes and narratives of Christian cosmology. Pawley calls     Gothic cathedrals the predecessors of the paperless office and the     electronic dealing room (30), implying that the windows     communicate data--albeit of an elevated, spiritual kind. His     thesis is thus an update of the traditional view that the Gothic     cathedral is the poor man's bible.     This thesis, though true, tells the least important part of the     story. For we know from contemporary writings that Gothic     ecclesiastical architecture was explicitly invented and designed     to carry into built form the vigorous blend of theology and     philosophy, Scholasticism, particularly associated with St     Bonaventure and St Thomas Aquinas (31). Scholastic metaphysics     classified light as a substance, an embodied spirit, which     distributes divinity to all God's creation (32). God is present in     all things, argued Bonaventure, because light emanates from even     the humblest material: glass is made from sand and ashes, fire     comes from coal, you rub a stone and it shines (33). Scholasticism     was far from philistine or iconoclastic, but it had a strong     subjective aspect which valued communion more highly than the     reading of words and images: revelation more highly than     information (34). And light was the main vehicle of revelation: St     Bernard of Clairvaux described union with God as immersion in the     infinite ocean of eternal light and luminous eternity (35).     Such luminous revelation was no vague psychedelic dazzle. For     medieval thinkers agreed with modern psychologists that the senses     are not just passive receptors of stimuli but have an active and     immediate rationality of their own (36). Light could communicate     directly to the intellect. The sanctuary door at the abbey of St.     Denis, for example, shone in gilded bronze, and its inscription     urged the pilgrim to let its luminous brightness illuminate the     mind so that it might ascend to the true light to which Christ is     the door (37).     So the Gothic cathedral was designed to be literally divine, as     immaterial and as luminous as possible. Architecture was to be as     ethereal as electronic phenomena. Through the stained-glass     windows, Divinity radiated more through light as essence than     through the images depicted on the windows. Light's primary role     was performative. The medium was the message (38).     Marshall McLuhan claimed of course that electronic media are     returning us to a medieval, pre-Gutenberg mentality. Much recent     art, design, movies and fiction, certainly, has the poetic and     abstract qualities associated with medieval culture: sublimeness,     grotesqueness, and artificiality. Like the medieval mind, we are     fascinated by fragmentation, complexity, translucency,     layering--and things which, jewel-like, glitter and glow (39). We     are all Gothic now.     The point I want to make is that every home needs windows--perhaps     electronic windows -- into the world. But we look though those     windows or screens neither just to take in or give out     information, nor just for instrumental motives. Everybody needs to     keep an eye, a window, on the world to reassure the self that it     differs from the world and thus to reinforce the self's identity.     Prisoners or patients permanently confined indoors want to know     what the weather's doing, though this knowledge is of no practical     use at all. Similarly, the amount of hard data broadcast by TV     news programmes is remarkably small, and what little there is     seldom affects our actions, but we seem to need at least     twice-daily fixes of it. So when the monitor pours light over us     like the pearly light of Vermeer's interiors or the jewelled     radiance of the Gothic cathedrals, we are not just reading data:     we are communing with what we see.     Modern culture has for a long time believed that information is     best communicated through words and numerals. Lately have we     accepted, rather grudgingly, that visual images might transmit     data equally powerfully. But if a large part of what is     transmitted and absorbed is not information at all, but light as     an essence, triggering some mental alteration, we may need to     downgrade the importance we have only recently conferred on images     and icons. Perhaps, for example, the search for virtual reality     overemphasises the need for figurativeness, indeed for reality at     all. To become so fixated on image-borne data as a vehicle for     purposive communication might lead us to forget the potential of     the computing media to communicate directly through abstract     light, colour and sensory immersion generally. We need to revisit     the tradition of transcendent abstraction epitomised by Mark     Rothko and continued by light-sculptors such as James Turrell.     The English phrase at home means to be at ease with oneself,     secure and enclosed. But the phrase at home also means to be ready     to welcome visitors into the home. Home wards off agoraphobia but     needs windows to ward off claustrophobia. Electronic windows might     admit the light of the telematic sublime.     Notes     (1) This talk was given on 4 November 1994 at the `Doors of     Perception 2 @ Home' conference in Amsterdam, organised by the     Netherlands Design Institute and Mediamatic.     (2) Bernard de Mandeville, The Fable of the Bee; or Private Vices,     Public Benefits, D.
