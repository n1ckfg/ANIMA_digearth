TickerTape Applet v1.3[Image]Read my article on Threads in the latest issue of JavaWorldHere is a listing of other Java applets from NetObjectiveThis is an applet which I wrote to allow any text to be displayed in asimilar fashion to a scrolling ticker tape. This applet is being madeavailable to anyone who wishes to have it on their home page.To add this applet to your page, simply add the following Java applet tag toyour HTML code. Since a Java applet is just another program running on yourcomputer, it has the ability to take input from a user. This program getsits input from parameters sent to it from the HTML tag. All parameters areoptional except for the HEIGHT and WIDTH which are a part of all Java APPLETtags. The different parameters will be described below.This is the minimal amount of HTML code needed to get the program running:<APPLET CODE="TickerTape"CODEBASE="http://www.netobjective.com/java/classes" HEIGHT=30WIDTH=400></APPLET>The values of the HEIGHT and WIDTH values can be adjusted accordingly. Theabove tag will provide the following Applet:Parameters are passed to Java by using the PARAM tag and the parameter nameand corresponding value. The PARAM tag needs to be in between the beginning<APPLET> and ending </APPLET> tags. This applet can be customized by usingthe following optional parameters:   * TEXT     This is the text you wish to be displayed on the ticker-tape.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="TEXT" VALUE="Please display this text">   * FONT     This is the font that will be used when displaying the TEXT. The     following values are legal:        o Dialog        o Helvetica        o TimesRoman        o Courier        o Symbol     The default font is TimesRoman which is also used if an invalid font     name is passed.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="FONT" VALUE="Courier">   * FONTSIZE     This is the point-size of the font used when displayed. The default     value is 15.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="FONTSIZE" VALUE=30>   * STYLE     This is the style of the font which can be used. The following values     are legal:        o Plain        o Bold        o Italic     The default style is PLAIN which us also used if an invalid style is     passed.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="STYLE" VALUE="BOLD">   * FGCOLOR     This is the color of the text being displayed. The following values are     legal:        o Black        o Blue        o Cyan        o DarkGray        o Gray        o Green        o LightGray        o Magenta        o Orange        o Pink        o Red        o White        o Yellow     The default foreground color is WHITE which is also used if an invalid     color is passed.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="FGCOLOR" VALUE="GREEN">   * BGCOLOR     This is the background color for the applet. The legal values are the     same as the foreground colors listed above. The default background     color is BLACK.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="BGCOLOR" VALUE="WHITE">   * DELAY     This is the amount of delay in milliseconds in between the printing of     each Character. The default delay is 100.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="DELAY" VALUE=50>   * CLICKURL [Image]     This is a new Web page that will be loaded into the browser when the     applet is clicked. If no value is present, nothing will occur if the     applet is clicked.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="CLICKURL" VALUE="http://www.netobjective.com">   * SHADOWCOLOR [Image]     This is the color of the shadow text. If this value is not given, it is     defaulted to the background color (BGCOLOR), and there is no shadow     shown.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="SHADOWCOLOR" VALUE="BLUE">   * DEBUG [Image]     If any value is passed to this parameter, debugging information will be     printed to the Java Console. This is turned off by default.If we use the above sample parameters we have the following HTML:<APPLET CODE="TickerTape"CODEBASE="http://www.netobjective.com/java/classes" HEIGHT=40 WIDTH=350><PARAM NAME="TEXT" VALUE="Please display this text"><PARAM NAME="FONT" VALUE="Courier"><PARAM NAME="FONTSIZE" VALUE=30><PARAM NAME="STYLE" VALUE="BOLD"><PARAM NAME="FGCOLOR" VALUE="GREEN"><PARAM NAME="BGCOLOR" VALUE="WHITE"><PARAM NAME="DELAY" VALUE=50><PARAM NAME="CLICKURL" VALUE="http://www.netobjective.com"><PARAM NAME="SHADOWCOLOR" VALUE="BLUE"><PARAM NAME="DEBUG" VALUE=""></APPLET>Which will display this applet:Alternative Color Selections   * RGBFGCOLOR [Image]     This value is this RGB hexadecimal equivalent for the text foreground     color. If the parameter FGCOLOR is not passed, RGBFGCOLOR will be used.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="RGBFGCOLOR" VALUE="00FFFF">   * RGBBGCOLOR [Image]     This value is this RGB hexadecimal equivalent for the text background     color. If the parameter BGCOLOR is not passed, RGBBGCOLOR will be used.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="RGBBGCOLOR" VALUE="00FFFF">   * RGBSHCOLOR [Image]     This value is this RGB hexadecimal equivalent for the shadow color. If     the parameter SHADOWCOLOR is not passed, RGBSHCOLOR will be used.     e.g. <PARAM NAME="RGBSHCOLOR" VALUE="00FFFF">Here is an example applet using the RGB colors:<applet code="TickerTape"codebase="http://www.netobjective.com/java/classes" height=40 width=200><param name="text" value="RGB Test"><param name="FONTSIZE" value=35><param name="RGBFGCOLOR" VALUE="018F81"><param name="RGBBGCOLOR" VALUE="E0E0E0"><param name="RGBSHCOLOR" VALUE="02FFF2"><param name="STYLE" VALUE="BOLD"></applet>To Do List   * Add the ability to have different links attached to certain text   * Allow images to be scrolled along with the text.Sites that use this applet.Due to the overhelming response from all of you submitting your requests,the list has been moved.
