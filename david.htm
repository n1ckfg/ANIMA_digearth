Trane reeling up on a tape deck. Fluorescent lamplight stealingin through the hospital window. A sleepy soprano. Serene/unguent.<P>A spitter gargles beside the scaly black feet of Martha Collier as she sitsin a wheelchair by the window. Off in the numinal. Staring outside at Kathe earth. Nut the sky. Ra creeping towards the womb of cosmic matter.<P>Night. <P>"Spit." Josaih puts the tip of the spitter between the cracked lips of thewoman who'd once been his professor. Now sucking up phlegm which has beenlodged in her chest since afternoon. "Drink." Putting a straw to her mouth.Waiting as a vanilla drink silts an itchy throat. "Priests would performrites to the stars."<P>"What was that professor?"<P>"Priests. In Ancient Egypt. Scribes interpreting. Propitiations made insacrifice for the safe return of Ra from the realm of the dead ... ...Ahhh,this doesn't interest you."<P>"Don't say that. It does. I'm just worried about the infection in yourchest."<P>"What interests young people these days Josaih? The educational system isfailing you. Churning you out like burgers at Drive thru. Leaves me ...curious."<P>"You should rest Professor."<P>"C'mon Josiah. Tell me ... honestly. What do you think of this music?"<P>"It's jazz. It's great. Miles n' those cats. But ... hip hops more my thing... This sounds like ... too heady. Thoughts. You know ... I struggle tofeel it."<P>"Take a deep breath."<P>"You're the one whose supposed to be doing the exercises."<P>"Just breathe ... o.k. there. Now get in touch with ... before theexplosion which became the civil rights movement. Martin. Malcolm. Trane'sprophetic unravelling of that consciousness."<P>There's a trigger pull of tippling notes as Josaih reaches up for a cloth.Then wipes spittle from a bottom lip.  <P>"It was recorded after brothers had returned from fighting in the SecondWar. Returning with hopes for an integrated society. Only to find Charliestill ran the store. Which is where Trane is coming from here. If you'velistened to earlier stuff. Like his playing on Kind of Blue. You can feelhis expanding vocabulary after the years with Miles. After the tutelagewith Monk. On his own. Stretching out the length of his solos at the clubs."Explaining." 25 and 50- different ways. Leading to ... this track.Equinox. Night and day of equal length as the sun crosses the celestialequator."<P>They stare out the window. Josaih noting malaligned bone jutting up atMartha's shoulder. Il pleut and books with broken bindings lie in heapsbeside their feet. Martha's crooked fingers reaching up to trace on thewindow ... a box on the inside of a circle.<P>"I wasn't born in a hospital you know. But in a village. Just some midwivesthere. My father waiting at the place of a friend for the news. Now ... Idie in the company of machines. Respirators. Things with names I'm hardpressed to pronounce. Which is what saddens me now. Not dying. Just knowingthe last think I'll be staring at is an I.V. drip in my hand."<P>"You're not dying."<P>"Homo sapiens have been making ... tools since the beginning. I'm notknocking the value of technical wizardry. But ... this whole thing ... thesplitting of the atom to ... clone sheep. You end up with ..."<P>She begins to cough. But tired stomach muscles fail her. "Spitter." Josaihlifting the suctioning tube to her lips. "Clean it first."<P>"Clean?"<P>"Turn it up then stick the end in some water."<P>He does so to the sound of McCoy Tyner flipping the track wide open. Hissolo a loungy stroll through the high end of a piano. Right into a backacheJosaih stretches out before tipping the hissing mouthpiece towards herlips.<P>"Are you ready for bed?" <P>"That word used to mean something else."<P>"Bed?"<P>"No. Technology. Like when Plato used the expression techne tou biou todescribe the craft of life. Techne wasn't just mechanical skill andinstruments but artful managing and careful shaping."<P>"You didn't say whether you're ready for bed."<P>"Not yet. I'm not ready yet. Not for bed. Not ... for death ... to bedoomed to die in a sarcophagus filled with the treasure of our age.Machines to prolong life. To end life. To make it more efficient. Dyingalone in among symbols of an Icarun flight too close to the sun."<P>"All right. You're dying. But you're not dying tonight. So why don't youclimb into bed. Save this conversation for a time when your chest isclearer."<P>"Do you know much about alchemy?"<P>"Professor!"<P>"Alchemists in the Medieval Period understood their work as the numinalrelating through the phenomenal. Their creation being a physicalrepresentation of an inner propensity towards individuation. Metaltransmutating through forms of poison before reddening. Robedo. To gold." <P>Phlegm moves in lungs and ... an effort. Clearing. Clearing again. BeforeJosaih dips a sponge into a bowl of water which is dabbed onto lips.<P>"That moment of completion was Logos hermaphrodictally merging with itsfemale counterpart - Eros. Like the circle which encloses the box I drew upon the window. Like Jung's opposite sexed soul image in the unconscious -this projection from within. Anima and Animus. Ones inner functionsconfronting and awakening sympathy with erotic feeling. Their unity aHieros Gamos- a Sacred marriage between God and man."<P>"I'm going to try rubbing your feet a little,"  he interrupts. "Try to getsome circulation happening."<P>"Eyebrow."Josaih scratches her eyebrow first before reaching down for toes."It's our lack of connection to that cosmology that I'm dying in. Trinketsand gadgets and gizmos. Triumph of an Apollonian order over against theDionysian. Disconnecting the natural and material from the mental and thespiritual. A connection I feel expressed in the music." She shrugs. Furrowsretreating at her brow. Skin sagging onto bone.<P>He reaches for a remote control. Hits the button which will play the trackover again.<P>NOTES:<P>The sound of falling rain/Equinox.Text projected onto a window/ rain streaks. Traffic.
