I was told that butterflies are to be treated with respect because they are the spirits of medicine people who have passed on.  From a book I learned of a tribe on the Solomon Islands where the elders, from their deathbeds, tell their families what kind of butterfly they will be when they die and that species will be respected.  From an elder I learned to follow the butterflies to the good medicines: the butterflies have become my teachers.  Every time I shoot a butterfly on a native plant I then look up the plant in my library of ethnobotany books.  I always find a native medicinal use for these plants." <BR><BR>-Mike MacDonald.  </TT><P ALIGN=center><a href="link1.htm"><IMG SRC="smallbt.GIF" border=0></A></body></html>
