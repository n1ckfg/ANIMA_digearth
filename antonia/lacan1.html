During this phasethe child does not discern between self and Other and sees itself as identicalwith the world. The overcoming of this stage is linked to the child's entryinto <A HREF="utterance.html">language</A>. <BR><BR>Leaving my country, entering another, I acquired a new language. <BR><BR>Lacan also locates here the original feeling of lack.<BR><BR>When saying 'ich bin' one in fact says 'ich, die die (imaginaere) Identitaetmit der Welt verloren hat'.<BR><BR>Wenn man sagt 'I am', sagt man eigentlich 'I who lost the (imaginary) identitywith the world'.<BR><BR>The feeling of <A HREF="nancypaterson2.html">lack is the location of theoriginal desire</A>, that to be one again with the world. And there is nogoing back, as one can never get into the same river. It is, in a sense,the Fall. <BR></TABLE> <BR><BR><A HREF="digital.html"><IMG SRC="mouth1.gif" WIDTH="61" HEIGHT="35" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom></A" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="50"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
