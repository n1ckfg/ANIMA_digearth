I left Germany, I became German. Self-categorization had notbeen required previous to the border crossing. My <A HREF="identity1.html">identity</A>was <I>identical</I><WBR> with its context. By leaving my home country and -cultureI entered a new stage of individuation: I experienced myself as different,just as the young child has to learn that it is not<A HREF="lacan1.html">one with the world</A>. <BR><BR>Associating or disassociating oneself with the aspects of an identity categoryas defined by the Other, dealing with rigid concepts of what constitutesthis category seems to leave only space for a reactive position. Is it possiblehowever, to apply Foucault's claim here that the &quot;discourse [in whicha group is talked about] can be both an instrument and an effect of power,but also a hindrance, a stumbling block, a point of resistance and a startingpoint for an opposing strategy.&quot; <A HREF="notes.html">[7]</A>; doesit make &quot;possible the formation of a 'reverse' discourse: homosexuality[e.g.] began to <A HREF="utterance.html">speak</A> in it's own behalf, todemand that its legitimacy or 'naturality' be acknowledged, often in thesame vocabulary, using the same categories by which it was medically disqualified.&quot;<A HREF="notes.html">[8]</A>? It seems to me that within the boundariesof the reverse discourse, the fixity of the dominant discourse can onlybe answered by a 'reverse' discourse of fixity.<BR><BR>To avoid the fixity that lies in the binary of self and Other, Judith Butleroffers the following concept of a non-essential concept of identity: &quot;Thatany consolidation of identity requires some set of differentiations seemsclear. ... That the identity sign I use now has its purpose seems right,but there is no way to predict or control the political uses to which thatsign will be put in the future. And perhaps this is a kind of openness,regardless of its risks, that ought to be safeguarded for political reasons....How to use a sign and avow its temporal contingency at once? It is in avowingthe sign's strategic provisionality (rather than it's strategic essentialism)that identity can become a site of contest and revision indeed, take ona future set of significations that those of us who use it now may not beable to foresee.&quot; <A HREF="notes.html">[9]</A><BR><BR>Judith Butler describes that in the construction of an identity a certiankind of <A HREF="identity1.html">repetitious 'play'</A> is of importance.&quot;How and where I play at being one [e.g. a lesbian, a woman...] isthe way in which that 'being' gets established, instituted, circulated,and confirmed.&quot; <A HREF="notes.html">[10]</A> But &quot;paradoxically,it is precisely the repetition of that play that establishes as well theinstability of the very category that it constitutes.&quot; <A HREF="notes.html">[11]</A><BR><BR>Following the logic of the <A HREF="barthes.html">atopic</A>, it is herewhere a space for a non-essential, 'unfixed' identity can be opened up:in the acknowledgement that identity is constructed from within binarilystructured cultures but rejecting the concept of its normative constructionit can begin to resist the confinement fo the other term of the binary.&quot;The 'I' is no longer a substancial essence ...but is nontheless a<A HREF="digital.html">mobile</A> function.&quot; <A HREF="notes.html">[12]</A><BR><BR>Under the assumption of the strategic provisionality of 'identity components'it becomes possible to apply Foucault's reverse discourse in a way thatlifts it out of a purely reactive state. <BR><BR>I would like to draw attention to the parallel nature of Butler's conceptof the non-essential identity and Barthes' concept of the atopic in thatthey presume the impossibility of arrival and emphasize the strategic importanceof the movement. <BR><BR>Movement like that of water, for which there is no lasting shape, no absolutestate of matter. <BR></TABLE> <BR><BR><BR><A HREF="utopia3.html"><IMG SRC="mouth4.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="60" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom></A" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="50"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
