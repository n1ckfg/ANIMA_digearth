Somewhere in Honduras near the Guatemalan border. Huge, beatup trucks were roaring past. The road was - as always - potholed and theconcentration with which I continued to stare at the holes in the road,trying to anticipate as early as possible what was actually hole and whatwas merely shadow, equalled a trance-like state. <BR><BR>Then suddenly, in the distance, a neon-gem, a glowing cloud of cool colourwith the amazing exotic, cool technological beauty of a U.F.O. and with the same promise of a different world out there, somewhere: A Texacogas station with mini-mart. The car pierced the aura of light and glid intothe sharpness of concrete and steel and familiar brand logos. <BR><BR>While the tank was being filled, we waltzed into the air-conditioned coolnessof the shop and went crazy over Hershey bars and M&amp;Ms. We spent a smallfortune, unashamed of it and of being so loud and so <I>gringo</I>, justas one is unashamed of singing loudly and out of tune in one's own shower.</CENTER><P></TABLE> <BR><BR><A HREF="digital.html"><IMG SRC="mouth2.gif" WIDTH="66" HEIGHT="38" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom></A" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="50"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom><BR></A></BODY></HTML>
