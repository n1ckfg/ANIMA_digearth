Theseare individuals that carry only a minimum of objects, cornerstones of theirlives. There is little evidence for or against what they will tell you.Their lives seem to consist of contained stories. With the practice of along trip and numerous encounters they seem to develop good abilities inpresenting themselves and their lives as very i n t e r e s t i n g andfulfilled. And so they also extend their facility for taking at face-valuewhat others have to say about themselves.
