Since they  qualitatively increase a species possibility of organising and controlling  the matter-energy in their ecosystem, their primary characteristic is that   of information. They are forms that inform; they are informed because they remember the past and make possible new types of projections into the  future. Anthony Wilden, System and Structure.    To suppose that an ecology of communications exists presupposes that there is an evolution to communications. That evolution is substantially one of co-evolution. Human culture is a product of evolutionary strategies. These primary tools of the human - art making, language, writing, - are the essential mnemonic mechanisms of human biocultural evolution and ecology. They are not only the bees that pollinate the gardens of our minds, but have had and will continue to have a symbiotic relationship to the potential uses of our minds ways of understanding. Ecology is not a homeostatic operation but the complex dynamic of evolutionary and syncretic potentialities. image 0 fluid skin 1 image><PARAM NAME="FONTSIZE" VALUE=30><PARAM NAME="FGCOLOR" VALUE="BLACK"><PARAM NAME="BGCOLOR" VALUE="CYAN"><PARAM NAME="SHADOWCOLOR" VALUE="WHITE"><PARAM NAME="CLICKURL" VALUE="http://www.digearth.bcit.bc.ca/dedocs/diss/one.html"><PARAM NAME="DELAY" VALUE=100></APPLET> </BODY> </HTML>
