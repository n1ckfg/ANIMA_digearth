Please find below some information regarding an initiative of the Digital Earth Foundation. It is a descriptive of a show of works dealing with the digital possible.   I will be in Europe for mid-March and April presenting the work of a number of Canadian (media/digital) artists - The trip is an explorative venture to get interest and partners.  I have at present a number of contacts but am seeking more names - of curators, institutions, galleries, artists - who may be interested in reviewing documentation of artitsts works - and who may consider being associated with the 'Ecstatic Data' inititative - by showing the works, collaborating on new work, etc... The cities on the list thus far are: London, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Vienna, and Milan.  So those of you in the know - please share your contacts! I know there is a lot going on in Eastern Europe and suggestions are very much encouraged.  As well, if you have or know of some Canadian artist that I should be aware of please send that to me directly. My email address is oliverh@intergate.bc.ca Thanks!   P.S.:  New VRML worlds up - part of my "Confessions of a Fallen Architect" project...(you do need a higher end PC to view!) as well as pics of the worlds (for those running Macs and etch-a-sketch boxes) at: http://www.mva.banff.org/~oliverh/heaven/A.html (intro. text) http://www.mva.banff.org/~oliverh/heaven/wrld.html    (wrlds) http://www.mva.banff.org/~oliverh/heaven/pict1.html   (jpegs) _________________________________________________________________________________ "Ecstatic Data" ProjectEcstatic Data: Knowing and UnknowingThe future may depend on us, but it is not possible to simply derive itfrom the past. Rooted as we are in a past that cannot fully be unraveled,the future for us is a seed with many potentialities.Attention to the future is an intrinsic element in culture (as in ErnstBloch's "Das Prinzip Hoffnung - The Principle of Hope"). The predicament ofhuman mortality and our always increasing dependence on the technologicalfix presents us as beings perpetually looking forward..Questions about the future of humanity have a descriptive and evaluativecomponent: what awaits us, and what should we do?Science and technology answer the questions of the future throughdissections, knowledge and manipulations.  Art responds by expressions ofthe eternal - in a process of remembrance/anamnesis - in play, passion,politics, or metaphoric conflations.  Time becomes encapsulated by aneternity in this remembrance because it is unrelenting in the certainty ofeach of its concluding moments.  "The new value placed on the transitory, the elusive, and the ephemeral, the very celebration of dynamism, discloses the longing for an undefiled, an immaculate and stable present." - Jurgen Habermas.    Thus a surprising inventiveness, a re-inventing and transfiguration that is artistic practice.  Nostalgia loses its morose tendency and becomes the absorption of insight and the creative thrust of the 'nocht-nicht', (the not yet of a percise and ecstatic sublime) - all illusion , all artifice, all art is this presentiment, this link to desire. "The characteristic quality of a creative person can perhaps be understood as a desire to supersede the concept of individuality by breaking through its limits, aided by a comprehension of the Beyond."Bruno Taut - 1917"Ecstatic Data" , an initiative of the digital eARTh Foundationis to sponsor a number of Canadian Media Artists who are working in an experimentalcontemporary manner with advanced media - digital video, robotics,installations and interactions of various sorts,- to explore questionsranging from teleology to eschatology, and from politics to perception as apremonition of this not-yet tomorrow. "The dream is its own interpretation." - The Talmud _________________Digital Earth Foundation: http://www.digearth.bcit.bc.ca/dedocs
