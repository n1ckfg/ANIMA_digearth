These poems criticise and joke about Internet,  man-woman relationships, the flood of July '96.  Their starting theme was "Po&eacute;tronique" which means poetry versus computer.  French words were written in html pages (3 poems=230 pages) because I was showing them on closed circuit, but they were not translated, nor enriched with images and sounds, nor placed on the web either, before I participated in Transverse Worlds.  These French poems depend for effect on changes in the word's meanings.  These poems work because they each have almost the same written pattern: they work on similarities of sound to extract astonishing meanings that indeed give body and soul.  The transliteration is called "Trans-Late":  it means that English speakers not fluent in French will gain access to sense at a later point.<BR><BR><HR width=80% size=4><BR><BR>As an example of what could be the working process of my poems, here's an english poem made on variations from verbs using the suffix trans:<BR><BR><BR><blockquote>Trans-Late means that it is never to late to let us translate from language to meanings,<BR><BR>Nor to transcode from thinking to writing,<BR><BR>Nor to transit from french to english,<BR><BR>Nor to transhume from humour to human,<BR><BR>Nor to transact with facts as acts,<BR><BR>Nor to transcribe a script of billions of bits (you bet!),<BR><BR>Nor to transfer fair to affair on the market place,<BR><BR>Nor to transfigure a transfused bloody good man,<BR><BR>Nor to transfix the neck of your friend just to take a steady snapshot of him,<BR><BR>Nor to transform the world in words of works (warm worms),<BR><BR>Nor to transcend sand scripts as sanskrit (Christ!),<BR><BR>Nor to transgress momentaly an agreeable agreement,<BR><BR>Nor to tranship pains and beliefs like frightening freights,<BR><BR>Nor to translite rate codes to a funny babelweb wedding,<BR><BR>Nor to transmit light like a lot of lite stuff of stuffit lite,<BR><BR>Nor to transmogrify the power of love in only love (...  alone),<BR><BR>Nor to transmute sound of silence as a muting mute up (...  and down...
