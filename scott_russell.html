As he described it in his "Report on Waves":(Report of the fourteenth meeting of the British Association for theAdvancement of Science, York, September 1844 (London 1845), pp 311-390,Plates XLVII-LVII).<br clear=left><BLOCKQUOTE>``I was observing the motion of a boat which was rapidly drawn along anarrow channel by a pair of horses, when the boat suddenly stopped -not so the mass of water in the channel which it had put in motion; itaccumulated round the prow of the vessel in a state of violentagitation, then suddenly leaving it behind, rolled forward with greatvelocity, assuming the form of a large solitary elevation, a rounded,smooth and well-defined heap of water, which continued its course alongthe channel apparently without change of form or diminution of speed.I followed it on horseback, and overtook it still rolling on at a rateof some eight or nine miles an hour, preserving its original figuresome thirty feet long and a foot to a foot and a half in height.  Itsheight gradually diminished, and after a chase of one or two miles Ilost it in the windings of the channel.  Such, in the month of August1834, was my first chance interview with that singular and beautifulphenomenon which I have called the Wave of Translation''.<br>(<a href = "JSRf.html">Cet passage en francais</a>)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>This event took place on the Union Canal at Hermiston, very close tothe Riccarton campus of Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.<P><a href="canal.jpg"><img src="canal0.jpg"></a><P>Following this discovery, Scott Russell built a 30' wave tank in hisback garden and made further important observations of the properties ofthe solitary wave.<p><a href="wave.jpg"><img src="wave0.jpg"></a><p>Throughout his life Russell remained convinced that his solitary wave(the ``Wave of Translation'') was of fundamental importance, butninteenth and early twentieth century scientists thought otherwise.His fame has rested on other achievements.  To mention some of his manyand varied activities, he developed the "wave line" system of hullconstruction which revolutionized ninteenth century naval architecture,and was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in1837.  He began steam carriage service between Glasgow and Paisley in1834, and made the first experimental observation of the "Dopplershift" of sound frequency as a train passes.  He reorganized the RoyalSociety of Arts, founded the Institution of Naval Architects and in1849 was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London.  He designed(with Brunel) the "Great Eastern" and built it; he designed the ViennaRotunda and helped to design Britain's first armoured warship (the"Warrior").  He developed a curriculum for technical education inBritain, and it has recently become known that he attempted tonegotiate peace during the American Civil War.<P>It was not until the mid 1960's when applied scientists began to usemodern digital computers to study nonlinear wave propagation that thesoundness of Russell's early ideas began to be appreciated.  Heviewed the solitary wave as a self-sufficient dynamic entity, a"thing" displaying many properties of a particle.  From the modernperspective it is used as a constructive element to formulate thecomplex dynamical behaviour of wave systems throughout science:  fromhydrodynamics to nonlinear optics, from plasmas to shock waves, fromtornados to the Great Red Spot of Jupiter, from the elementaryparticles of matter to the elementary particles of thought.<p>For amore detailed and technical account of the solitary wave,see R K Bullough, <em>"The Wave" "par excellence", the solitary, progressive great wave of equilibrium of the fluid - an early history of the solitary wave</em>, in <b>Solitons</b>, ed.
