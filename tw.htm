Transverseworlds subverts the singular detached viewpoint with the intrusion andjuxtaposition of alternate perspectives voiced from within the links, text,image, and essays.<BR><BR><hr><BR>transversal  includes the subjective alongside the theoretical.transversal invites discourse which frames artists work in the contextof their own histories and other parallel histories.  Ficto-criticism is thenotion of combining the personal with the objective.  web based art thattransverses is a program of immersion into the subtleties of links betweenvarious dimensions of electronic cultural production and consumption,between various mediums, artists, aesthetics, practices,  politics andsites.<BR><BR><hr><BR><BR><br><BR><BR><DD>contact: <a href="mailto:thecla@cs.sfu.ca">thecla@cs.sfu.ca</a> <br><dd> or:  <a href="mailto:oliverh@intergate.bc.ca">oliverh@intergate.bc.ca</A><DD><BR><BR><hr><BR><BR><BR>		              <br><br> <p><H2><A HREF="default.htm"> <IMG SRC="ltimage/bitclot1.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A> <br><br><br><P>
