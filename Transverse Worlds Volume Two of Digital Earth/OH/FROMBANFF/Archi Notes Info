An intense visual and musical  essay about the complex of architecture, in its social and ideal forms.An Architextural JourneyTo you through visual letters of an incomplete alphabet discovered by a contemplation of Bruegel's Tower of Babel to the Pantheon in Rome to Schinkel's Berlin to Barcelona's Modernismo to Chicago's skyscrapers to the mind reading birds of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul to the immaculate whores of Amsterdam to the other worldly Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar, South India to a cloud between Heaven and Earth to the erotic sun temple at Konark to the City of Light known in ancient days as Kashi now as Varanasi to Palladio's "Rotunda" to Renzo Piano's "New Metropolis" to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's aesthetic to the significance (partial) of the Shiva-lingum to the structure of a zygote to the shape of water  to how, yes, Albert Speer finally died. GENRE   - trance essay/speculative narrative -A launch pad about the space of tomorrow and the constructs of yesterday.  An immersion on the history/future of architectural meaning. - post-modern society: a secular form of eternal life - Industrial society has been 'Building Heaven' since the Crystal Palace of London's Great Exposition of 1851. This modern trend reflects a long held human ambition - the construction of an earthly Heaven, - an architecture of Utopian proportions. From Olympia's Temple of Zeus, to the pronouncements of the Russian Constructivists, to the the skyscrapers of Chicago, much of architectural history is driven by a demiurge to bring the perfection of the sky and the geometry of the eternal, to the mortal earth. The development work for this project has found support from The Canada Council for the Arts, DNA MultiMedia, SGI's CosmoWorlds, Future Tense Media, B.C.
