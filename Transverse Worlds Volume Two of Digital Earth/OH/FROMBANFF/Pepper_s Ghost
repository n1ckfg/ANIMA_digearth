Old-fashionedvampire traps, scrims and flats were too clunky to impersonate rainbows,ghosts or fantastic transformations.So if a ghost were to appear, namely Pepper's Ghost, someone or somethingoffstage would be lit so the waves bounced off a piece of glass,strategically placed at an angle. The reflected image would appear to beonstage. This illusion is replayed exactly during the nickelodeon scene inCoppola's version of "Dracula." In one shot, a woman in Victorian dressturns into a skeleton.Pepper's Ghost is also shown in Barnouw's The Magician and the Cinema. Anobscure (there are only 4 copies in the entire US library system right now)small press book on magic called "The Trick Brain" has some interestingcomments on variations like Kellar's Blue Room Illusion. Author DarielFitzkee first wrote it in 1944, and the third edition was published by MagicLTD/Lloyd E. Jones in Oakland, CA.The basic strategy of projecting through a partially mirrored, angled sheetof glass made up one of the earliest forms of "back projection" in film,called The Shuftan Process. That way, Hitchcock was able to film theclimactic chase scene in his first s ound film "Blackmail" (1929) as if thewhole thing had taken place at the British Museum.The Shuftan Process is illustrated in Brosnan's Movie Magic.     [Image]     The Picture Palace Home PageEmail The Picture Palace at picpal@picpal.com, use our new voicemail/faxbacknumber 1-800-261-0906, or write to PO Box 281, Caldwell, NJ 07006.
