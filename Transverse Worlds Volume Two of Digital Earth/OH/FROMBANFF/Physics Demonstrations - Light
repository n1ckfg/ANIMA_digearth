6LIGHTAs with electricity and magnetism, the study of light developedindependently until 1865 when James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), by apurely theoretical argument based upon a missing symmetry in the known lawsof electricity and magnetism, added a term to the equations and predicted aform of electromagnetic wave that travels with a speed exactly equal to thethen-known speed of light (3 x 108 meters/second). In one swoop heconsolidated light, electricity and magnetism, as well as other forms ofelectromagnetic waves, many of which were yet unknown. Although light is aform of wave, in many instances, its behavior can only be understood byresorting to a particle description, not unlike the description thatprevailed from the time of the ancient Greeks up through the time of IsaacNewton (1642-1727). The modern theory is that light has a dual nature thatrequires a quantum mechanical description. Light is a particularly suitablechoice for demonstrating electromagnetic waves because complicatedinstrumentation is unnecessary since our bodies come equipped with a pair ofremarkably sensitive and versatile optical detectors.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Laser Safety ConsiderationsLasers are especially useful sources of light for demonstrations becausethey are monochromatic, coherent, collimated, and intense. However, theincreasing use of lasers in optics demonstrations poses special hazardsparticularly to an unwary audience[1-4]. Since most such demonstrationsinvolve the use of relatively low power lasers operating in the visiblerange, the discussion will be restricted to them. High power lasers andlasers operating outside the visible range pose additional hazards andshould only be used by a laser expert. The greatest hazard from visiblelasers is damage to the retina of the eye. When light is focused by the eye,the intensity on the retina is concentrated by a factor 104 to 106 over thatfalling on the pupil of the eye. The dangers include the production ofvisible lesions; permanent, partial "bleaching" of the pigment for oneparticular light color; and complete blinding if the optical nerve is hit.Special glasses or goggles can be used to protect the eyes, but they areusually impractical in a demonstration before a large audience.To estimate the danger, one must know the power or energy output, P, of thelaser in watts or joules; the beam diameter, D, at the aperture of the laserin centimeters; and the beam divergence, ø, in radians. The intensity ofradiation at a distance d (in centimeters) away from the laser is thencalculated from I = 4P/(pi)(D+dø)2, in watts per square centimeter if P isthe laser power, or joules per square centimeter if P is the laser energy.This value can be compared with the damage threshold values in Table 6.1. Itcan be seen that even small demonstration lasers can cause eye damage if thebeam strikes the eye directly. The laser light can usually be safely viewedafter diffuse reflection (such as from a piece of paper), but specular(mirror-like) reflections must be avoided. Note also that an individuallaser may exceed the specifications listed by the manufacturer.In order to enhance safety, one should never allow the laser to operateunattended. The illumination in the room should be kept as bright aspossible to constrict the pupils of the observers. One should set up thelaser so that the beam is not at normal eye level. A diffuse, absorbing,fire-resistant target should be used. One should remove all watches andrings and other shiny objects in the vicinity of the laser. Lenses can beused to defocus the beam, and shields can be placed to prevent the beam fromgoing beyond the area needed for the demonstration. In general, the lasershould be treated as an ordnance piece with similar security and safetymeasures. With these precautions, the laser permits many, very impressive,visual demonstrations.REFERENCES1. E. A.

The laserilluminates one end of the rod which is polished. The entire rod lights upalong its length due to scattering off imperfections in the rod. A brightspot appears at the opposite end of the spiral. The effect is best whenviewed in subdued background light. Such a configuration illustrates theprinciple of the light guide* (also called a "light pipe").One can show other examples of light guides, especially the flexible kindmade of many fine strands of glass (fiber optics). With modern, low lossfibers, light can be sent for many miles with very little attenuation[1-5].Attenuation in modern fibers are less than 1 dB/km. Such technology couldeventually revolutionize communications because the high frequency lightprovides a transmission medium with extraordinarily large bandwidth. Ratesas high as 27 gigabits per second have been demonstrated. This is equivalentto 400,000 telephone conversations. By maintaining the relative position ofthe many strands within the bundle (a coherent fiber bundle), it is possibleto pipe an image from place to place. Such devices are useful for seeing inplaces that are inaccessible to the eye, such as inside someone's stomach byuse of an endoscope.DISCUSSIONThe light guide illustrates the principle of total internal reflection.According to Snell's law,** light traveling in a medium with index ofrefraction n1 and incident on a material with index of refraction n2 at anangle (theta)1 with respect to the normal at the interface, is reflected atan angle (theta)2 with respect to the normal. If n1 is greater than n2, thenthere is a critical angle (theta)1 = (theta)c such that (theta)2 = 90Á.Light incident on an interface with (theta)1>(theta)c will experience totalinternal reflection. In this case, n1 = 1.51 for plexiglas, and n2 = 1.0003for air. Thus the critical angle is (theta)c = sin-1(n2/n1) = 41.6Á. Thecondition for total internal reflection is easily met provided the lightguide is long and skinny and not bent at too sharp of an angle.**The experimental discovery of this law is usually credited to WillebrordSnell (1591-1627), but it was also deduced from the particle theory of lightby RenÚ Descartes (1596-1650) and is known as Descartes' law in France.HAZARDSThis demonstration is safe provided one exercises normal caution to preventthe laser and its specular reflections from shining in anyone's eye.REFERENCES1.

The light is provided by a carefully aimed laser that shinesthrough a window opposite the hole through which the water streams. Thewindow can consist of a piece of glass bonded with putty or bathtub cementover a hole in the tank. Alternately, a light bulb can be lowered into thewater. In the latter case, the bulb should be as bright as possible (a fewhundred watts), and the inside of the tank should be white or shiny so as toreflect as much of the light as possible. The water can be caught in atrough on the floor. The tank should be tightly sealed to prevent escape ofthe light, but it must allow air to enter as the water leaves. The effect isbest viewed in a darkened room. Fluorescin or other fluorescent substancemay be added to the water for increased visibility. The tank should containenough water to provide a nearly constant flow for about a minute (a fewgallons), and the height of the water column should be a good fraction of ameter to provide sufficient pressure at the aperture as required for asteady stream of water. One can hold one's hand in the water stream toilluminate it and to show that the stream actually consists of water. As thelevel of water in the tank decreases, the stream bends at a sharper angleuntil suddenly the condition for total reflection is violated, and a brightspot is seen on the opposite wall.DISCUSSIONThe index of refraction of water is 1.33, and thus the critical angle for awater/air interface is sin-1(1/1.33) = 49Á. So long as the water stream doesnot bend at too sharp an angle, light traveling along the length of thestream strikes the water/air interface at an angle greater than 49Á withrespect to the normal to the interface and is thus totally reflected.HAZARDSIf a laser is used, care should be taken to ensure that it does not shineinto someone's eye. If a light bulb is immersed into the water, it is bestto use a low voltage bulb, such as an old 12-volt automobile headlamp tominimize the danger of electrocution. The lamp should be immersed in thewater before it is turned on to prevent it from being broken by the thermalshock. The water stream should be aimed so that it will not damage otherequipment, cause an electrical hazard or make the floor slippery.REFERENCES1. H. A.

The stick is waved so rapidlythat one's persistence of vision produces a continuous image. The effect isbest when viewed in subdued light. It is necessary to focus the projector ata distance such that the image can be clearly seen from the back of the roomand to wave the stick at the right place to obtain a well-focused image.Some practice is required to get the optimal distance and light level.Alternately, the slide projector can be placed on the floor behind thelecture table and aimed upward. A mirror at the back edge of the lecturetable then deflects the light horizontally so that the projector is notvisible to the audience. In the place of the stick, one can also use avibrating string or rope. A picture of some well-known figure such as AlbertEinstein is appropriate.DISCUSSIONThe principles involved are rather rudimentary and involve geometricaloptics and the physiological process of persistence of vision. One can wavethe stick at various rates to illustrate the extent of the visualpersistence. The effect is analogous to the role of the persistence ofvision in television and motion pictures and to the scanning process in thetransmission of a television picture.HAZARDSThere are no significant hazards with this demonstration other thaninadvertently striking something with the stick or stumbling in the dark.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------6.4Optical IllusionsTransparencies containing optical illusions are projected on the wall or ascreen to illustrate the role of subjectivity in scientific experiments.MATERIALS   * transparencies of optical illusions   * overhead projectorPROCEDUREAlthough optical illusions are often discussed in the context of psychologyand art, they can also be used to illustrate principles of physics. Booksand articles[1-10] provide numerous examples of optical illusions.Many ofthese illusions can be photocopied onto transparencies and projected on ascreen for viewing by a large audience. Impressive three-dimensionalillusions can also be created but generally must be viewed from a particularangle and thus are less suitable for large groups.As an example of how optical illusions can be used, one might show thefigure of a clown that turns into a circus scene when rotated by 90Á or thesketch of George and Martha Washington watching troops out a window thatturns into a portrait of Washington when turned upside down. Such illusionsare amusing and surprising, but can also be used to illustrate the role ofsubjectivity in physical observation.DISCUSSIONFrequently, detailed observation of a phenomenon reveals information notapparent and sometimes even contradictory to that gleaned from a casualobservation. The result of a physical measurement often depends upon theframe of reference of the observer as in the theory of relativity, and theact of making an observation can change the thing observed as in theHeisenberg uncertainty principle. As human beings, and as scientists inparticular, we must observe carefully and objectively and guard against thetendency to see in nature only what we expect to see.HAZARDSThere are no significant hazards in the observation of these illusions.REFERENCES1.

A shag carpet or strawon the floor helps conceal the bottom edge of the mirror. Near the back ofthe table in the center and behind the mirror, a circular hole is cutthrough the table top of sufficient diameter to pass the head of thesubject. The table is initially covered with a cloth that reaches to thefloor on every side.A volunteer is taken from the audience around to the back of the table by anassistant who helps the volunteer kneel or sit with the head protrudingthrough the hole in the table while the demonstrator, who at this pointemulates a magician, holds the tablecloth in such a way as to conceal fromthe audience what is happening to the volunteer. A little patter about thesimilarities and differences between science and magic fits in well here. Afew grunts and groans from behind the cloth add to the drama. Finally, whenthe volunteer is in place, the cloth is removed, and the audience ispresented with the illusion that a disembodied head is resting on the table.One can carry on a conversation with the head, culminating perhaps in a punabout restoring the body while the victim is "ahead." In a magic show, thevolunteer would be removed from the table, and the audience would be left towonder how it was done. However, in a science demonstration, the volunteershould be removed in view of the audience while the demonstrator explainsthe trick.The illusion is most effective if the mirror is very clean and its edges areconcealed. The table should be placed well away from other obstructions thatwould be eclipsed by the mirror. If a carpet is used, it must be alignedcarefully so that there is no discontinuity at its edge where it goes behindthe mirror. One should be careful not to stand directly in front of thetable lest the reflection of one's legs be seen in the mirror. The tableshould not be placed too close to the audience to avoid reflections of theaudience. The illusion works best if the audience is seated slightly abovethe level of the top of the table. The proximity of the audience to the headwould seem to favor discovery of the trick, but, on the contrary, it isindispensable to its success.DISCUSSIONAlthough this demonstration is more amusing than educational, it serves tointroduce, motivate, and illustrate the idea that the angle of incidence isequal to the angle of reflection in geometrical optics. It also illustratesthe danger of being deceived in making observations of nature and of theimportance of considering all possible explanations of a phenomenon beforereaching a conclusion.HAZARDSThere are no significant hazards with this demonstration. Care should betaken when moving the mirror to avoid breaking it, and the volunteer shouldbe cautioned not to lean or push against the mirror.REFERENCE1. D. H. Charney, Magic, Strawberry Hill Publishing Company: New York(1975).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------6.6Pepper's GhostThe phenomenon of the partial reflection of light at the interface betweentwo media with different indices of refraction is illustrated by an illusionin which a person or other object is made to disappear and reappear at will.MATERIALS   * large plate of glass   * two spotlights on dimmer controls   * candle and beaker of water (optional)   * skeleton or ghost (optional)PROCEDUREThe simplest demonstration consists of a candle and a beaker of water[1].The beaker of water is placed behind the glass, and the candle is placed anequal distance in front of the glass so that the audience sees the beakerthrough the glass and sees the reflection of the candle in the glass. Itlooks as though the candle is burning under the water. A black shieldbetween the candle and the audience prevents the audience from seeing thecandle directly.A more elaborate demonstration[2] requires a much larger piece of glass (atleast five feet square). The glass is placed at a 45Á angle to the audienceso that the audience sees a combination of light passing through from behindthe glass and light reflecting off the glass at a 90Á angle from the line ofsight. Spotlights on dimmer controls can alternately illuminate the areabehind the glass or the area off to the side. One light should be turned upwhile the other is turned down in such a way that the total light intensityis nearly constant. This can be done automatically with a single control, orwith practice by manipulating a pair of controls, one in each hand. In thisway, people and other objects can be made to appear and disappear at will.It helps if the background behind both objects is dark and if a partition isprovided to prevent the audience from directly seeing the object off to theside. The room lights should be lowered to prevent the members of theaudience from seeing their own reflection. By proper manipulation of thelights, a volunteer can be turned into a ghost or skeleton and back again.It is important that the person and ghost or skeleton be placed in exactlythe right position and that a volunteer be chosen who is nearly the sameheight as the ghost or skeleton (see figure). With proper placement, thefigure will change continuously from one to the other independent of theviewer's position in the audience. In practice, a viewing angle of about 60Ácan be accommodated, depending upon the width of the glass. This arrangementalso makes an effective and dramatic entrance and exit for the demonstrator.Glitter sprinkled from above in place of the skeleton aids in the appearanceand disappearance.DISCUSSIONA light beam incident on the interface between two transparent media ofdifferent indices of refraction (such as air and glass) is partiallytransmitted and partially reflected. Thus the light emitted from such aninterface consists of the superposition of light traveling through the glassfrom behind and light reflected off the glass from a direction such that theangle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. By controlling therelative intensities of the two sources of light, one scene can be made totransform into another.HAZARDSThere are no hazards with this demonstration other than the danger ofbreaking the glass.REFERENCE1.

Abowl of water with a mirror immersed in the water can be used instead if aprism is not available. The effect is best if the light is highly collimatedand the room darkened. This can be accomplished by placing a slide with atransparent slit about a centimeter wide in the projector. Alternately, ifthe sun is in the proper position, light passing through a window and a holein a shade can be used. A laser can be used to demonstrate that the effectoccurs only for white light. To illustrate better the formation of rainbowsby raindrops, a spherical flask of water can be used. Mirrors can be used torotate the spectrum into the usual position (arched in the center with redon the top). With a variac the intensity of the lamp can be controlled toillustrate that at low temperature the light is mostly red but that theshorter wavelength colors successively appear as the temperature of the lampis increased. Point out that there is radiation below the red (infrared) andabove the violet (ultraviolet) but that our eyes are not sensitive to thesewavelengths. The band of wavelengths to which the eye is sensitive is thesame as the wavelengths for which we receive the maximum radiation from thesun. This apparent coincidence is probably a result of biological evolution.DISCUSSIONThe dispersion of white light into its constituent colors occurs because theindex of refraction of water and most glasses varies with the wavelength ofthe light. Typically, the index of refraction is given by n = A +B/(lambda)2, called the Cauchy formula, where A and B are experimentalconstants that depend upon the type of glass and (lambda) is the wavelength.Substances with a large value of B have the most dispersion. For mostglasses, the index of refraction is about a percent greater at the shortwavelength (violet) end than at the long wavelength (red) end of the visiblespectrum. The result is to refract the violet light more at the interfacebetween the air and the glass. The triangular shape of the prism causes therefraction at the entrance and exit interfaces to add rather than cancel asthey would for a plate of glass.Prism spectrometers are useful for determining the composition, temperature,and distance of stars. In the laboratory, spectrometers are used to identifythe composition of materials, since each chemical element has its owncharacteristic spectrum of emission lines.The refraction of sunlight off moisture and density fluctuations in theatmosphere is what makes the sky blue and the sunset red[1]. When the sun isnear the horizon, light from overhead is mainly a result of the largerefraction of the blue end of the spectrum, while light coming from thedirection of the sun is very little refracted and thus appears red.HAZARDSOne should not look directly into a bright source of light but ratherobserve the spectrum as projected on a screen or wall.REFERENCE1.

Greenler, Rainbows, Halos, and Glories, Cambridge University Press:Cambridge (1980).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------6.8Laser GunA sufficiently powerful laser is used to burst balloons from across theroom.MATERIALS   * high power laser (at least one watt average power)   * assorted colored balloons and pieces of colored paper   * beam dump   * optical lenses (optional)PROCEDUREIf a sufficiently powerful laser is available, spectacular demonstrationscan be done if one is careful to avoid the hazards inherent with intenselight sources (see the section on Laser Safety Considerations). A laser ofat least a watt average power is desirable. Pulsed lasers with high peakpower and lasers outside the visible range can also be used but are moredangerous and are not recommended. The beamline should be arranged to avoidthe possibility of shining the laser into someone's eye, and the usualprecautions of avoiding specular reflections should be strictly adhered to.The laser beam should terminate on a beam dump capable of dissipating allthe power of the laser without significant reflection or heating. A long,corrugated metal pipe, blackened on the inside and gently bent into acircular arc makes a suitable beam dump. Reducing the background room lightmakes the laser beam more visible but also makes the eye more sensitive andsusceptible to damage.If the laser is of marginal power, one can focus the laser beam with a pairof lenses. A diverging lens with a long focal length is placed in the beam.The diverging beam is then brought to a focus with a converging lens with ashort focal length. Not only does this make a very intense spot, but itdefocuses the beam and makes it safer for the audience.With a laser of this class, it is possible to burn holes and ignite piecesof paper and to burst balloons. A light-colored paper or balloon reflectsmost of the light and is more difficult to burn or burst than one with adark color which efficiently absorbs the laser light. A particularly nicedemonstration is to enclose a black balloon inside a clear one. The laserbeam can be made to pass though the clear balloon and burst the blackballoon. Balloons filled with flammable gas (methane, hydrogen, etc.) cannotbe ignited directly because such gases are transparent to the laser beam,but with an appropriate piece of paper taped to the balloon, the paper canbe set on fire, and the gas indirectly ignited.DISCUSSIONAlthough a watt is a relatively small amount of power, the laser has theability to concentrate this power in a spot of only a few millimetersdiameter. If the surface on which the laser beam is incident absorbs thelight efficiently enough, the heat can puncture or ignite the material. Thecolor and to a lesser extent the texture of the target determines how muchof the light is absorbed. Light not absorbed is either reflected ortransmitted through the target. A magnifying glass outdoors on a sunny daycan similarly be made to concentrate light to the point where it ignites atarget. With a sufficiently bright incandescent or arc lamp and anappropriate lens, the same can be done in the lecture room to illustratethat there is nothing special about using a laser other than its naturalcollimation.When performing this demonstration, it is difficult to avoid implicationsabout the prospect of directed energy weapons[1,2]. Although it appears toillustrate the feasibility of such applications, it can equally well be usedto illustrate the ease with which a target can be made such that practicallynone of the laser light is absorbed.HAZARDSThis demonstration is potentially very dangerous. If the light from a laserof this class impinges on one's eye it can cause almost instant blindness.This demonstration should thus be done only by someone experienced with theuse of high power lasers and only after taking the necessary precautions toensure that the laser beam cannot be reflected into someone's eye. The laseris also capable of burning one's skin and setting fire to any flammablematerials placed in its path.REFERENCES1. K. B.

The room is darkened to render the beam visible. The beam canbe made much brighter by clapping together two chalk-board erasers coveredwith chalk dust or by use of a commercial smoke generator.The possible uses for such a laser beam are very numerous[1,2]. One canillustrate the monochromatic nature of the laser light by passing it througha glass prism and comparing the result with the result of passing acollimated beam of white light through the same prism. The beam can bescattered off various objects. A fine-mesh screen or diffraction gratingproduces an interesting interference pattern when illuminated with a laser.The beam can be passed over a knife edge, through various fluids and vaporsor through lenses of various types. A laser beam can be reflected off asmall mirror mounted on a loudspeaker connected to a source of sound. Withtwo such speakers, one can construct a crude, low-frequency oscilloscope anddisplay Lissajous patterns by connecting the speakers to sinusoidal sourceswith harmonically related frequencies.For a sophisticated audience, the following puzzling demonstration isrecommended. An equal amount of water is poured into each of two Styrofoamdrinking cups. The laser is aimed at one of the cups for a few seconds. Thecups are turned upside down. Water comes out of one cup, but little or nonecomes from the cup that was illuminated with the laser. The water was soakedup by a sponge surreptitiously placed in the bottom of the cup before thedemonstration. This trick doesn't help one understand light but does give agood opportunity to discuss the importance of careful observation andcontrolling all the variables in an experiment.DISCUSSIONA laser is characterized by being intense, collimated, monochromatic andcoherent. A laser beam travelling through clear air is essentially invisiblebecause there is very little scattering of the light off the air molecules.Chalk dust or smoke provide a multitude of tiny particles from which thelaser beam can scatter. Since the laser beam is monochromatic, it isdeflected through a constant angle by a prism and is not dispersed.Coherence means that the photons of the light are all vibrating insynchronism with the same phase rather than with random phases as inordinary light. The monochromatic and coherent nature of the beam makes itideal for interference and diffraction experiments.HAZARDSThe only significant danger from a laser in this class is eye damage fromlooking directly into the beam. Care should be taken in setting up thedemonstration to ensure that the laser beam cannot be directed or reflectedinto someone's eye.REFERENCES1. H. H.

Saint Paul Avenue,Milwaukee, WI 53233PROCEDUREAfter a motivation consisting, for example, of viewing a rainbow spectrum ofwhite light, one introduces the idea of invisible light, in particular,infrared and ultraviolet. The room lights are extinguished, and anultraviolet lamp turned on. Ultraviolet lamps can be purchased from mostvendors of scientific supplies or from florists or hardware stores. Variousminerals and other fluorescent materials are placed under the lamp. Somearticles of clothing fluoresce nicely. Common household products thatflouresce are Murine eye drops and Pearl Drops toothpaste. The adventurousdemonstrator can brush his or her teeth with such toothpaste and continuethe lecture with teeth glowing bright yellow. The coating on the inside ofthe glass of a fluorescent lamp works well except for the fact thatultraviolet light does not easily penetrate the glass. Breaking such tubesis not recommended since the fluorescent material and the mercury in suchtubes are highly toxic.A particularly appealing demonstration is to add about 0.01 g of fluorescein(Na2C20H10O5) to 500 ml of an aqueous solution of 0.8% polyethylene oxide(Polyox WSR-301). Polyethylene oxide is a viscoelastic liquid with manystrange and delightful properties such as the ability to self-siphon[1].With a pair of 1000 ml beakers, one can start pouring the liquid from onebeaker to the other. When one tries to stop pouring it, the liquid continuesto run up and over the rim of the upper beaker in seeming defiance ofgravity. The stream of liquid can be cut with a pair of scissors, and theupper part of the stream will jump back into the upper beaker. Thefluorescein renders it visible under ultraviolet light and provides quite astriking visual effect.DISCUSSIONFluorescence is the process whereby a substance absorbs light at a shortwavelength and then re-emits it at a longer wavelength. All that is requiredis appropriately spaced energy levels in the atoms that constitute thematerial. The fluorescent lamp is the most common example. In such a lamp,electrons produced by a filament at one end of the tube travel down the tubeand excite atoms of mercury vapor in the tube. The mercury emits ultravioletlight which strikes the fluorescent coating on the inside of the glass.The atoms of a fluorescent material typically re-emit their radiation afterabout 10-8 seconds. By contrast, phosphorescent materials continue to emitafter the incident radiation is removed, sometimes for hours. Such materialsare used in paints and on the hands of watches and clocks. Otherlight-emitting processes are chemiluminescence in which the light isgenerated by a chemical reaction and triboluminescence in which the light isgenerated by a mechanical stress in a crystal.Viscoelastic liquids consist of molecules containing long chains of atoms,often numbering into the millions. If such materials could be viewed underenormous magnification, they would look like a plate of spaghetti. With themolecules sufficiently entangled, they exhibit both high viscosity andelasticity. One needs to exercise some care in handling these materialssince heat or vigorous stirring can break the molecules and degrade theeffect. They should be prepared within a day of use and stored in arefrigerator.HAZARDSIntense ultraviolet light can damage the eyes. One should avoid prolongedstaring at such lamps. In extreme cases, other parts of the body can receivea sunburn.REFERENCE1. A. A.

After pointing out the spoton the wall to the audience, the Bunsen burner is lit. The spot begins todance around like a twinkling star. Then the Bunsen burner is extinguished,and the spot stops moving.Alternately, in place of the laser, one can use a slide projector and aphotographic slide of stars. Lacking a suitable slide, one can make one withaluminum foil with a number of pin holes perhaps arranged in the form of theBig Dipper or some other easily recognized constellation.Don't miss the chance to play that famous composition by Mozart thateveryone knows as "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."DISCUSSIONLight travels in a straight line only when traveling in a medium withconstant index of refraction. The index of refraction of air dependsslightly on temperature. Thus the hot air above the flame of the Bunsenburner deflects the light slightly, and in a time-varying way, due to theturbulence of the air above the flame. This is exactly what happens when oneviews the stars through the turbulent atmosphere of the earth. In that casethe temperature gradients are smaller, but the path length is much longer.The myth abounds that stars twinkle, but not planets. If this is so, it isonly because on the average the planets appear larger, and thus the effectis less noticeable. The apparent position of the moon presumably dancesaround in a similar way, but it occupies such a large segment of the skythat we never notice it.This phenomenon is what makes it ineffective to simply build ever largertelescopes to improve the resolution of objects in the sky. Satellite-basedtelescopes or telescopes positioned on the moon would benefit from largersize.HAZARDSThe usual precautions concerning lasers should be observed. Set up thedemonstration so that there is no chance of the laser beam being directedinto someone's eye. The Bunsen burner is an obvious source of fire andburns, especially if the demonstration is done in subdued illumination.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------[Previous Chapter] [Introduction] [Server Home]J.
