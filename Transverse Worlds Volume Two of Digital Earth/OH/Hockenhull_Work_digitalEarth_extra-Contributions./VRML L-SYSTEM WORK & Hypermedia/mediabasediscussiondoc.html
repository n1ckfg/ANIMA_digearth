<H1>Mediabase</H1>Oliver
Hockenhull/Jeff Berryman<P>This is a discussion document that
offers a new research focus for CISR's (The Centre for
Image and Sound Research) collaborative multimedia
program.

This theme is relevant to the post production editing of
multimedia and traditional video/film, and to more general
questions of multimedia interactivity.  This paper also
intends on explicating some of the formal properties of
the new mediums and suggests the application of this
understanding through novel software design principles.The
basic idea is to apply database technology to the creation
andstructuring of media art works.  The hypotheses are
that media art works can be usefully represented as
databases, that such databases ("mediabases") can be used
as practical tools to support shared invention,
production, and delivery of both interactive and linear
media works, and that database science allows for a new
class of forms for interactive work. <BR> <HR> Code,
Structure, Script <HR> A mediabase is a computer database
whose purpose is to store a media work or information
pertaining to the structure and creation of a media work.
The mediabase will give access to the formal
characteristics of a new media work and may blend
production content, script, and, in some cases, production
data.  In an interactive work a viewer's interventions
would be implemented as database retrieval operations, and
the presented images and sounds would be data extracted
from the mediabase.  For a traditional work (film or
video) edited in a non-linear editing suite,  the
mediabase would, allow for editors to automate some of the
task presently processed through the labours of editing
decision lists.A number of current interactive media
works, notably nonfiction works that deal with archives,
are concerned with presenting contents of informational
databases.  Such databases, which we call domain
databases, are not complete mediabases in the sense that
we are using the term here, because they contain the
content of the work (or part of it), but not any script,
production, or presentation data.  Every media work
involves script, production, presentation, and content
data.  In current practice, this data is recorded in
various ad-hoc ways.  Under the mediabase concept, this
data is organised and integrated in machine-readable form,
in a way that allows the use of contemporary database
tools.  The extent to which the data can be captured in
this way and the extent to which it must be transformed to
be integrated effectively are research issues.<BR> <HR>
Research Opportunities<BR>

<HR>

Taking the database approach to media works might lead us
down a number of research avenues:

<BR>

Mediabases would be good for supporting collaborative
work, in that a mediabase can have specific elements that
are created, maintained, and shared in organized ways by
the various individuals and teams involved with the
creation process. Research in this area would entail
analysis of media works creation processes, and design of
appropriate database structures to support the required
collaborative relationships.  An important challenge would
be to develop common concepts for minimizing the number of
different database designs needed to support the various
media and styles in current practice.Database technology
is presently highly evolved in the areas of data sharing
and distributed access.  This represents a great potential
advantage, one which could help this project produce
usable early results.
<BR><HR>

<A HREF="syntacticaltools.html">Navigation</A><HR><BR>Mediabases
are not intended to be only administrative tools for
organizing production teams.  The intent is to develop
data design and programming principles that render
mediabase systems capable of implementing aesthetic
principles in media works.  One project in the aesthetic
area would apply database techniques to the problem of
selecting paths through navigable works.  At present, such
paths usually must be completely preprogrammed.  As the
complexity of interactive genres increases, this will
become less and less feasible.  Where discrete works or
fragments are merged, preprogrammed navigation may be
completely impossible without re-doing whole productions.
Also, preprogramming may in some cases  be aesthetically
undesirable.  In general, there is a need for computer
assistance in the making of navigation decisions.If we
think of a linear work as a particular traversal of a
navigable one, it becomes evident that navigating and
editing have much in common.  Montage theory describes the
meanings of cinematic transitions (editing) in terms of
the attributes of the shots and scenes involved.  This
project would seek to apply montage theory to the
navigation problem, using a database implementation
approach.  The research would first devise a methodology
for representing shot and scene attributes in relational
database form, then develop software to use those
attributes for helping make navigation decisions in
interactive works.  This software would present to the
user, at each interactive decision point, those navigation
alternatives that would tend to have the most cinematic
meaning.  Thus, the interactive work would tend to foster
valid viewer experiences, regardless of how much
preprogramming had been done or not done.In the project
plan we wish to develop several stages of montage software
development, beginning with simple algorithmic code, and
ending with mixed-initiative expert systems.This project
concept is based principally on the ideas of Oliver
Hockenhull, a Vancouver filmmaker, writer and communition
theorist, who has for several years been working on the
concept of applying montage theory to interactive works.

<BR><HR> The Associative Work & Self-Contextualization<BR><HR>

<A NAME="hypermedia">Most of today's interactive media
work is based on the hypermedia concept, in which data
elements can contain one or more pointers that sviewers can
follow to reach other such elements.  Thus, a hypermedia
document is a network, in which data elements form a
multiply connected nonhierarchical graph.</A>Navigation,
the process of following pointers from <A
HREF="ontotheground.html">one data element to another</A>,
is a concept akin to hunting, in which the viewer "goes"
from one place to another, seeking an objective.In order
to produce a hypermedia work capable of delivering a rich
viewer experience, its creators must develop and present a
large and complex context -- a cyberspace...Generally
speaking, creating cyberspaces is time consuming and
expensive.The hypermedia model does not easily support
works based on gathering, rather than hunting, paradigms. 
In such works, the counterpart of navigation is
association, in which elements are gathered from global
contexts and arranged to form local contexts.<A
NAME="mediabasediscussiondoc.html#associative">Associative
works</A> are works that offer the viewer the ability to
gather elements from a global context and arrange them
into one or more private contexts.  Association is a
relational activity, in which the viewer builds contexts
through interaction with the work. We call an associative
work self-contextualizing to suggest that each viewer's
particular context is created afresh from the elements of
the work, without starting from a prebuilt global form. We
envision the primary elements of an associative work as
follows:	<P>1.	One or more search spaces, which are
databases from which the viewer may 	extract elements
of content.  The union of all works search spaces is
referred to as its global context.  Many, if not most,
works will have only a single search 	space in their
global contexts.	<P>2.	One or more gathering tools
that the viewer can use to find elements in the global
context.  These tools may be common to all search spaces,
or specific to 	particular ones.	<P>3.	One or
more personal workspaces for each viewer.  For many works,
these workspaces would be non-volatile, to allow
continuity over multiple 	sessions.  The structure of
the workspaces would vary from work to work, and 	could
vary from simple to complex.	<P>4.	One or more
arranging tools that the viewer can use to arrange
gathered 	elements in the workspaces.It is natural to
envision the user interface to such a work as one that
would allow many different objects -- images, animations,
sounds, and so on -- to coexist in a single multimedia
presentation at once.  Which elements were combined and
juxtaposed would vary, depending on the what objects the
viewer had gathered and how she or he had arranged them in
the personal workspace.    

<BR><HR>Searches, Continuity, and Style<hr><BR>

In most associative works, how searches work will
be the strongest single determinant of viewer experience.
We believe that most associative works will support
mixed-initiative searching, i.e. a searching in which
gathering choices are made jointly by the viewer and by
the work itself. One class of mixed-initiative systems
features searches that depend on the contents and
arrangement of the viewer's current personal context.  For
example, the montage approach described above provides a
way for searches to be qualified by cinematic attributes,
these choice of an attribute is selected by the viewer.
Specifically, the searches in a montage-based associative
work are constrained to find only (or mainly) those
elements that are cinematically meaningful in the current
personal context.    In a mixed-initiative associative
system, as a viewer built up her or his own workspace,
successive searches would tend increasingly to find
objects that "worked"in it, contextually.  Thus, the
system could support continuity  and style.  The system
would learn the viewer.<BR><HR>Publication and
Combination<HR><BR><A HREF="reddust.html">An attractive
outcome</A> of the gathering process in associative works
is that the personal workspaces created by the viewers
(or, if you will, co-created by the viewers and the
original authors) are themselves valid artifacts that may
be preserved and shared as searchable contexts.  We say
that a personal workspace offered to others as a
searchable context has been published.Given certain
standards, search spaces that had never "met" each other
before could be combined to create new possibilities.  For
example, CISR could concatenate an associative Cunningham
Archive search space with search spaces from other
artists' archives of the same historical period to allow
viewers to find new associations.Current database
technology is moving toward an object-oriented paradigm,
in which data elements and the programs that use them are
bundled into relatively self-contained units  ("objects").
Because they are self-contained, these units tend to be
more easily shared between contexts, and transported into
new ones.  Thus, having object-oriented mediabases would
facilitate the reuse of published media material, the
combining of disparate media works, and other interesting
integrations.  Making sharing and reuse of work easier has
its risks, in that intellectual property and integrity of
creative results can be more easily compromised.  This
risk would be offset somewhat by the fact that modern
database tools have highly developed access control
facilities which, if properly invoked, can provide highly
selective and secure restrictions.<BR><HR>Project
Scope<BR><HR>This R&D project extends from cinematic theory to
database theory, with the results having immediate
practical application.  The results would depend
critically on effective interweaving of technical and
aesthetic disciplines.  A number of outcomes might be
supported:  Various commercial and/or prototypical
production tools could be developed to serve the different
interests mentioned in Opportunity, above.  Sponsorship of
exploratory and/or demonstration art works and the
development of a montage software package would be a clear
option. To do the subject justice, collaboration with
Banff and other sites inside and outside Rapport would be
indicated.  Finally, the idea would seem to offer good
potential for academic research at the graduate and
possibly faculty level.<BR><HR>Conclusion:<BR><HR>It is fruitful
to consider the digitalization of media creations (film,
video, or interactive multimedia) as a distributed
database problem in which the work is realised as a single
shared database ("Mediabase") that is designed, built, and
used in various ways by the creative team.  For
interactive works, the database and associated programming
codes would also be the work's final form.  For
conventional linear works, the final assembly process
would be a specifically formatted extract of the
database.This approach is distinct from merely using a
multimedia user interface as a way to access an
informational database in which the information in the
database is viewed as domain data.

intent, software structure, and user interaction is a
necessary departure for furthering eloquence in the new
media.<BR><HR></STRONG></I><P> </PRE><BR>
