<I><P>GENESIS</P>
</I><P>My interest in the subject matter was spurred by encounters (in the same week) of the photographic work of Karl Blossfeldt and the studies in L-Systems by Professor Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz of the University of Calgary.</P>
<P>Blossfeldt was a sculptor and art teacher by profession, but he is best known today for his studied, meticulous photographs of plant forms.</P>
<P>His work first became known in Berlin in 1928 when a selection appeared in the volume "Urformen der Kunst" (Archetypes in Art). </P>
<P>The photographs reflect a creative interpretation of the relationship between nature and art, nature and architecture, nature and form.</P>
<P>Blossfeldt's study reveals the art that is nature - an art based on the incredible complex of survival in a dynamic environment. </P>
<P>The photographs present the efficient and necessary forms used (and re-used) by nature, simultaneously they are visual articulate assumptions concerning the interdependence of the human world and the plant world (and thus of the human and the world/cosmos itself). The architectural association of the natural world and the human, based as both are on certain givens (gravity, geometry, chaos/whimsy, shelter, transit, etc.) of the shared larger environment, are made evident in the images.</P>

<I><P>VIRTUAL MODELS OF MORPHOGENESIS </P>
</I><P>In my research into the study of plant forms and the recurrence of designs in nature I came across the work of Professor Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz of the University of Calgary. Professor "P" as he is called in computer graphic circles is one of the foremost researchers in virtual models of morphogensis (the form and structure of animals and plants - more exactly: the formation and differentiation of tissues and organs). The Professor has been instrumental in furthering the implementations of Lindenmayer-system modelers (L-Systems). </P>
<P>Inspired by the software that Professor Prusinkiewicz had developed I initiated a research project with the assistance of The Banff Centre for the Arts. This research carried out with the crucial programming assistance of </FONT><A HREF="http://www.netstart.com/tmalaher"><FONT FACE="New York">Tom Malaher</FONT></A><FONT FACE="New York"> integrates L-Systems within a VRML environment. The initial model, a plant growing in the 3d VRML network environment, was built in early 1998. </P>
<P>The intent here was to demonstrate L-Systems in a VRML environment and propose the possibility of creating an ever changing environment in virtual reality. L-Systems could and can be used to create extensive, complex, dynamic environments in virtual space. They could and can be used to build the worlds themselves - to not only provide the walls, floors, and plans of the polygon environment - but elements within that environment - 3dL-Systems seemed an ideal way of creating an every changing, interactive, environment. </P>
<P>I proposed to develop the potential of this integration in a DVD and online site that would take as its subject matter the issue of the architectural, nature, and the human. The work would apply models of morphogenesis to a virtual architectural environment that users would travel through, change as they willed (or allow for other sorts of parameters to change the environment -time, chance, etc...), viewing content - video documentary sequences evocative of the question. The initial research proved promising in allowing the insertion of L-Systems <I>directly </I>in the VRML environment.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">NOT LIVING BY CODE ALONE </P>
</I><P>VRML and L-Systems are just a few strands of intrigue generated by the all consuming interest in architecture. </P>
<P>Architecture's relation to nature, the starting point of the investigation branched out to encompass, necessarily, the nature of the human. </P>

<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">"Much wonder groweth upon me, yea astonishment seizeth me. Men go abroad to wonder at the height of mountains, at the huge waves of the sea, at the long courses of rivers, at the vast compass of the oceans, at the circular motion of the stars; and they pass by themselves without wondering."</P>

<P>So the research now turned to architectural history, architectural theory, and to the very meaning of architecture itself.</P>

<P>What is implied by a building? Surrounding walls, enclosing spaces resonance of time, culture, economy, civilization.</P>
<P>From the eloquent silence of the formal relationship of natural necessity, the geometric and gravity's of our buildings come to be. The circle, the plane, the square, all the permutations of dimensions plus time. The earth is the source of the material and weighs our dreams of building with the demanding grammar of place. </P>
<P>Primary art, architecture, the built environment, sign and symbol of civilization and culture, an aspiration in stone, in wood, in mud, in glass, in dreams, in form, to inform the human about their place in the world.</P>
<P>Architecture is the imprint of the construction of meaning upon space. It is thus intimately related to a cultures understanding of itself.</P>
