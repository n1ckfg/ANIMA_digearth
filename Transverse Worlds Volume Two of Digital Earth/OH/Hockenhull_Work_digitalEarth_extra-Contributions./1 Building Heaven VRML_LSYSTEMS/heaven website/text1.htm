And certainly about the digital identity. The content and formal aspects of the work could not have been achieved with out both technological achievements in digital technology in the past couple of years and the conceptualizations of the virtual body, the virtual world - the bounding together of distances and spaces, of culture and nature - a vehicle of transformative possibilities - a complex of references that speaks to the necessity of rememberance of the traditions of the past - and how we may honour the past only by a profound investigation of our present world. This 'new' questioning of identity, based on developments in technology that is being raised by the so many contemporary writers is not, of course something new. </P><P>Certainly Pascal and Leibniz speculated on much the same issues, and even earlier writers and philosophers blew apart the belief in the determining ego as the basis of 'identity'. The current belief in a continuing self or ego that is being challenged by the morphic quality of the binary code is only a blip on the screen anyway in reference to the history of this question...the question once again as to Who is the Self. Reflecting on identity as being ephermeral, linked to desire, and situated finally in nature (the nature of the human as a being driven by a future perfect - the technological utopia- and by the fullness of nature outside of individual identity)- tropes are presented in the work which are visual clues as to this referencing of the 'digital identity' - the identity of uncertainty, non-human, maybe immortal, anonymous. </P><P>____________________ <DR></P><P>-statement two- </P><P>Architecture is a continually developing science and art. The subject of architecture is the subject of the human built environment as it relates to human based problems, needs and desires. These problems are ever new and greater, and these desires are continual reminders of human ingenuity and achievements. Through an understanding and appreciation of the cultural codes inherent within the built environment - and importantly- through a cross cultural and comprehensive historical approach we may come to understand ourselves and the completeness of our needs as they relate to our humanity, our human frailty, our spirituality, and the collectivity of our future. </P><P>My work tends to combine the political, the poetic and a critical analysis originating from a thorough immersion into the subject at hand. I also like to play off of a narrative stream. The tone of this work, its voice speaks from the position of individual mortality and social generation. The piece is also pervaded by a sense of immediacy and question that engages the audience through the links of historical understanding, human initiative, and human urgencies. The intent of this art/essay is to provide emotional, conceptual, and resource tools for imaging a livable tomorrow based on a cross cultural historical and contemporary reading of architectural language. </P><P>The work reflects on the sense of unity as it is found in the built environment. It is concerned about our intellectual and spiritual aspirations as they are bound to the confines of our naked needs in this particular time. The work is also future focused, concerned with the quest for sustainability, and in referencing the ecological to allow for a deep study of the cultural impact of architecture in how it is we live. </P><P>- Oliver Hockenhull </P></FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="build.htm"><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=5>"Building Heaven, Remembering Earth:&nbsp;</FONT></A></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="build.htm"><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=5>Confessions of a Fallen Architect"</FONT></A><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp;</P></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">____________________________</P></FONT><P><IMG SRC="4.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=12><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"> A poetic, visual and musical essay on the confines of architecture.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; </P></FONT><P><IMG SRC="4.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=12><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000">  Produced, written, directed, and edited by Oliver Hockenhull.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; </P></FONT><P><IMG SRC="4.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=12><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"> Music by Lisa Walker, additional Music by Dennis Burke.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; </P></FONT><P><IMG SRC="4.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=12><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"> Versioned for broadcast (104 minutes/Beta-SP) and home video release and as a 5 channel video installation&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; </P></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">____________________________&nbsp; </P></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Produced with the Participation of:</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; </P></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>The Canadian Independent Film and Video Fund,&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; </P></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>The Canada Council for the Arts,&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; </P></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>and The British Columbia Arts Council.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; </P></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>A Banff Centre Co-Production.</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; <BR>____________________________&nbsp; <BR>____________________________&nbsp; </P></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Installation &amp; other inquiries: E: </FONT><A HREF="mailto:ideoplastic@crosswinds.net"><FONT FACE="New York">Oliver Hockenhull</FONT></A><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ffffff">.</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; <BR>____________________________&nbsp; </P></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Broadcast/Festival Distribution:<BR>Video Out Distribution,</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; <BR></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000">E: </FONT><A HREF="mailto:videoout@telus.net"><FONT FACE="New York">to order tapes through net</FONT></A><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000"><BR>T: 604.872.8449 ;</FONT><FONT FACE="New York"> &nbsp; <BR></FONT><FONT FACE="New York" COLOR="#ff0000">1965 Main Street, Vancouver, <BR>British Columbia, Canada, V5T 3C1.</FONT><FONT FACE="New York">&nbsp; </P><DL><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD><DD>&nbsp;</DD></DL></FONT></TD><TD WIDTH="0%" VALIGN="MIDDLE" HEIGHT=703><P></P></TD><TD WIDTH="0%" VALIGN="MIDDLE" HEIGHT=703><P></P></TD></TR></TABLE><P>&nbsp; </P></BODY></HTML>
