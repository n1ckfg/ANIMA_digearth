<FONT FACE="New York"><I>It is said that God punishes his people by taking away his architects.</P></I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Boull&eacute;e</P>____________________________</P><I><P>THE DOOR IN THE FRAME/THE DIGITAL VIDEO PRODUCTION </P></I><P>The work became a diarist account, having the feel of an 'on the go' millennium-end tour of some of the world's architectural sites . The intent was to create an essay about the complex of architecture, in its social and ideal forms. The work, of necessity, is cross cultural, situating itself through a nomadic and trans historical perspective into a future of associative cultural references. The work is an expansive, real and imaginary journey, at times self reflexive (and thus questioning) of its own panoptic complicity. </P><P>The document is a plenitude of investigation; at times a roaming leisurely reverie, at other times or modalities a maze of alhambraic intensity and transparency, a mirroring of human urgency in the face of crisis - personal and cultural. </P><P ALIGN="RIGHT">____________________________</P><P>I had thought this study was about architecture and nature and then I thought it was about homelessness, a wanderer knowing he may never have a home and then I realized that what I wanted to talk about was the lack of coherence and meaning in the world around me - the world that is in Lewis Mumford's still caustic words is a world of "car dominant streets, blank glassy buildings - glares of competitive architectural advertisements, the studied monotony of high-rise slabs, ...buildings and quarters that lack any aesthetic identity and any human appeal except that of superficial sanitary decency and bare mechanical order." </P><P ALIGN="RIGHT">____________________________</P><I><P ALIGN="CENTER">I searched for an original dwelling, the unique womb of knowing and unknowing, I travelled to the prehistoric rock caves of Bhimbetka in Madya Pradesh, I went to the works of Palladio, to the Pantheon...</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">Here too I recognized a sameness, not the monotony of modernism - but the everywhere dream of the human - a creative reading and production built out of negotiations - cultural and personal - with survival, with nature, with the libidinal, and with the unconscious and liminal</I>.</P><P>____________________________</P><I><P ALIGN="CENTER">SUFFERING FROM A FATALISM OF ARCHITECTURE</P></I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">____________________________</P><I><P>From the video</I>:</P><P>W.</P><P>"The first book on architecture is, in fact, ten books - the ten books of Vitruvius. " </P><P>M. (overlap)</P><P>"Well, it is the first book that we have...I mean there were probably other books..."</P><P>W</P><P>"The Roman Vitruvius. He lived at that time of the Caesarean expansions, forty years before Christ, in what the old scholars called the Golden Age..Eight of the books are about buildings...but then the two other books are about machines and time pieces...time pieces as in sundials...using the shadow cast by the sun to tell the time...its the shadow that&#146;s important(...the insubstantial shadow...)" </P><P>(The Pantheon 'fits here')</P><P>____________________________</P><P>Our buildings reflect a machine ideology of straight lines. Their economy is a lie in the face of the wealth and complexity of the real of nature. Our buildings robotosize the human - surrounding in a world of predictability which is also a lie and perversity to the uncertainty (a fated romance) of the world. </P><P>We have given over our own evolutionary potential to the machine.</P><P>Not the envisioned future machines that are an integrate with the chaotic and singular system of the world, but the pocket calculating machine that slices and dices the eternal, a machine that allows you to go where ever you want today- as long as it is an office.</P><P>We do not acknowledge sufficiently the shadow that sustains the contrast and perspective of an awakened eye.</P><P>This shadow radiates from our personal and collective evolutionary past and present. A purely erotic beam, it is at the same time wholly difficult to discern, a formlessness that is the first and final attraction of form. </P><P>(The Shiva-Lingum 'fits here')</P><P>____________________________</P><I><P>BODY</P></I><P>Fleeting dream of water, needs, desire and tomorrow - spun from whirls around the sun. Our bodies ever desiring, ever growing, ever dying. This home of flesh, memory, want and ignorance. This home generated by an evolution of an uncanny proposition: life.</P><P>Our only home and the original architecture. A momentary skin sounding out the presents of incalculable time and dimension. The machine for living, the unsurpassed interface between will, consciousness and the given monument of the cosmos.</P><P>We are adrift in our destiny, the currents that break around us is our living architecture. </P><P>This is the labyrinth.</P><P>____________________________</P><P>"Thus the foremost and truest fact about any form is that it is a symbol, so that when contemplating something in order to be reminded of its higher realities, the traveler is considering that thing in it universal aspect which alone explains its existence." </P><P>Abu Bakr Siraj ed-Din, </P><P>-The Book of Certainty-</P><P ALIGN="RIGHT">____________________________</P><I><P>From the video</I>:</P><P>W.</P><P>These documents are reminders of desperation and leisure, pictorial examples of incongruences in time and culture allowed for by traverses of political, economic and real geographies.</P><P>M.</P><P>Making meaning to discern the horizon through the night of a hollow and infertile life - the suddenness of lightening in a pervasive miasma called a today without a tomorrow.</P><P>When lying in your bed the room you exist in is not made from stone or wood but from memory, desire and loss. Windows of imagination spring into being and even the possibility of rekindled and impossible joy appears as doors to a somewhere else that feels more like home than any architectural actuality.</P><P>W.</P><P>The dark behind your eyes is the obfuscation of a dense cloud, a cacophony of symbols and signs. The full and noisome universe of a history of tension, debt and balance, of gravity and aspiration, thunderous and fated steam ships of the heart. Your house is founded on, naturally, an abyss that is hallucination, a libidinal economy that is as regulated as the most conservative of National Banks in other words a myth - the myth, for all myths are the one myth of the beginning and ending of the world.</P><P ALIGN="RIGHT">____________________________</P></FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="mailto:hereticfilms@shaw.ca"><FONT FACE="New York">contact</FONT></A>
