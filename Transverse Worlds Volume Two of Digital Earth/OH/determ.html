Itsovert concerns are the issues surrounding the actions,arrests, media attention and sentencing of the VancouverDirect Action Anarchist group.The Vancouver Direct Action group carried out the mostviolent political protest in Canada since the OctoberCrisis. They blew up the Litton Cruise Missile plant, -an industrial plant in Ontario that built a hi-techcomponent of the U.S. Military Cruise Missile, - amongsta number of other "actions" in 1982-83.</DD><center><IMG SRC=schiz.GIF></center><HR>"What makes DETERMINATIONS so extraordinary is that itcombines three different ideas, anyone which would besufficient for a lesser film, into a richly intersectingweave.  We feel the filmmaker's clear condemnation ofwhat he regards as oppression and destruction; the film'sediting patterns encourage the viewer to think aboutcause and effect and evaluate the material from anethical perspective, and yet stylistically the work is abrooding, poetic meditation on its maker's horror of thesuperficialities of the world media scape...What is mostimpressive about the film is its overall emotionalimpact."  -  F. Camper, The Chicago Reader.<HR>"Revolutionary trash." - Ian Caddel, The Georgia Straight.<HR>"A driving warp speed dissection of the Squamish Fivestory, with a soundtrack that alone is worth the price ofadmission." - Elizabeth Aird, The Vancouver Sun.<HR>An austere political/poetic/analytic film from the lateeighties that denounces the mass media trance and itscreation of the illusion of freedom. <HR>75 minutes-- 16 mm - colour and B.W. --Sound/Music: Burke/Hockenhull, DOA, The Subhumans, Gerry Hannah.Festivals: The Leipzig International Documentary Film Festival,The World Film Festival - Montreal.For rental:<AHREF="mailto:oliverh@intergate.bc.ca">oliverh@intergate.bc.ca</A>
