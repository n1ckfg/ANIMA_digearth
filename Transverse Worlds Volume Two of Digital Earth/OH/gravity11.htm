Theconcentration here is on the questions posed by thebinary-code revolution.  The film acknowledges, criticallyexamines and attempts to, in poetic, visionary, andsometimes humorous language to explicate the exceptionalpotentials of the New Media Order. <P> David Odhiambo, ablack actor, acts as a surrogate voice, an 'other'inflection that brings to the fore the difference betweenhuman reality and the cultural erasures inherent incyberspace.<BR> <BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="mind.gif"></CENTER><BR>Personal in tone, the film also recalls the impact ofHuxley's LSD-25 and mescaline experimentations andwritings for a whole generation of youth and examines theutopianistic impulses associated with the recent Ravescene.  The work reflects the aesthetics and poesis of thepsychedelic state without collapsing into the tie-dyecliches that have trivialized  the '60's era. <P>The filmweaves together this material with sections from a 1957CBC  interview with Aldous Huxley, and footage shot in LosAngeles on May 1, 1994 at the Huxley Symposium.  DoctorJean Houston, a senior advisor to the United Nations onmatters of Human Development, eloquently speaks on theimmense contribution Huxley made concerning the possiblehuman.<P><P> Produced with the assistance of: The Canada Councilfor the Arts, The National Film Board, BC CulturalServices and Telefilm Canada.
