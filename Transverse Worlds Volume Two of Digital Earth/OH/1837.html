The Americans succeeded and their struggle was called a glorious revolution while fame and honor was the reward of her heroes -  Canada is now unsuccessful and her struggle for independence is called a foul and unnatural rebellion while the dungeon chains and the scaffold await the leaders of her forlorn hope.  -A New York newspaper account of the failed Canadian Revolution of 1838-  <HR>Entre La Langue Et L'Oc&eacute;an is Hockenhull's take onthe present state of Canada's perpetual identity crisesthrough a focus on the failed Revolution of 1837/1838 andon a "Canadien" who was banished to the penal colonies ofAustralia for having taken part in the Revolt.The film is a 95 minute walk along theborder of the historical and the hysterical.<HR>Beginning with a confession.

(The spindoctors have operated long before television.)-- If therewas no more immediate revolts against Imperialism it'sbecause Canadians were sensible to authority not becausethey were frightened into submission, their houses burntand their intellectual leaders hanged or sent to theantipodes penal colonies1 ...<HR><center><IMG SRC=Marek.GIF></center>Image from the film "Entre La Langue Et L'Oc&eacute;an" <HR>"This was almost too much for human patience...the citywould have been ours in an hour probably without firing ashot; hundreds of our friends waited to join us at itsentrance; the officials were terror struck; Gov. Head hadfew to rely on; the colony would have followed the city;aconvention and democratic constitution been adopted. andabloodless change from a contemptible tyranny to freedomaccomplished . But 800 ran where no one pursued, andunfortunately ran the wrong way." William Lyon MackenzieCanadian Revolutionary 1838.<HR>The value of the nation state is commensurate with itsmythological characteristics.  Meaning the nation stateis equal to its value as a political entity in referenceto inscriptions and historical events that signal ofJustice, Freedom, Equality, Intelligence, and Respect andthe fostering of the potentiality of the individual inacknowledged responsibility to the collectivity that isthe State through (Direct) Democratic associations. TheseWestern Enlightenment and Revolutionary notions, thisheritage of a Radical approach to Law and socialstructure and function, has not been attained.The nation state is a redundancy, quaint venues formaintaining tourist trades and as placebo for  marginalcultural, social, and technological luddities, --struggling lumpen proles. International capitalre-configures  itself into newly defined power blocks,opposition flounders in local struggles  unable tograpple away the descriptive and prescriptive power  ofthe Agenda and its thorough media pedaled persuasiveness.THE WORLD The perpetual war of Capital has come home toroust as perpetual un and under employment and thestruggle for subsistence, swaying, magnetized under theinvisible velvet gloved iron hand of the New Right- NewLeft - the old fascism on technological speed.Now Individualism = The Pathological Eccentricities ofEverywhere Narcissism.Corporations have become the rationale of governmentexistence. People, and the very possibility ofarticulation of difference has become subsumed under thelogos of the dominant consumer product/lifestyle. All theideals originating with Liberalism and the DemocraticRevolutions that created the Nation States have beenco-opted and incorporated as an aspect of consumerism.As the Bank advertisement states: "We are concerned withthe only Life that really matters - Yours."As capital becomes more and more mobile the worker, thecitizen, the definable by place culture and the nationstate itself becomes a side show of the transit and speedof power.Every place becomes either a factory or a tourist trap.<HR>"To articulate the past historically does not mean torecognize it "the way it really was". It means to seizehold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment ofdanger... Only that historian will have the gift offanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmlyconvinced that even the dead will not be safe from theenemy if the enemy wins.  And this enemy has not ceasedto be victorious." Walter Benjamin.<HR>At the very least, however, there has been put intocurrency concepts of dialogue and rhetorical tropes thatare means to leverage power by calling down the hypocrisyand injustices of the State.<HR>St. Benoit surrenders. Jean Joseph Girouard, leader ofthis group flees. This is his description of the eventsthat followed:" A considerable number of the inhabitantswere assembled in my courtyard and two cannon placed inthe gateway were aimed at them while they were told thatthey would be exterminated in a few minutes...  Therewere no insults and outrages which were not heaped uponthem, no threats which were not made to intimidate theminto declaring the hiding places of those who were calledtheir leaders.  Thus began scenes of devastation anddestruction more atrocious than any seen in a town takenby storm and given over to pillage after a long, hardsiege.  After completely pillaging the village, the enemyset fire to it and reduced it from one end to the otherto a heap of ashes.  They then went in differentdirections, ravaging and burning on their way, carryingtheir fire as far as the village of St. Scholastique."In Quebec and in the rest of Canada the defeats of1837/1838 has had subtle and not so subtle consequencesthroughout our collective histories.They resonate in the animosity between Quebec and therest of Canada, between Native and non-Native, they arereflected in the Canadian well recognized inferioritycomplex and the inability of Canadians to control theirown destiny. I am not saying that everything would bewonderful if the Revolution had been successful, I cannot of course predict an alternative future, however itwould have marked the end of colonial rule through theestablishment of a collaborative English and FrenchRepublican- Revolutionary government.  This would havebeen the auspicious beginning of collaboration betweenpeoples.  It would have, according to the declaration of(Canadian) independence (yes there was such adocument)given universal suffrage to the Nativepopulation - something that the Canadian government hasonly fairly recently granted.  And  importantly it wouldhave created an environment of certainty as to theviability of the Nation."Politics is the science that teaches the people of acountry to care for each other."William Lyon Mackenzie1836<HR>Footnotes1 See Anthony Wilden's "The Imaginary Canadian" for aninformed political and psychoanalytical reading of thesecrucial events and their aftermath.2 Concerning the disappearance of the nation state andthe disappearance of the  'great narratives' see PaulVirilio's "Speed and Politics", and Lyotard's articles"Universal History and Cultural Differences" and "TheSign of History"3  A key example - Canadian films account for only 3 percent of Canadian theatre time-lower than the percentageachieved by domestic films in any other industrializedcountry in the world. This is not only an example of thesorry state of the Canadian domestic film "industry" andthe complicity of the Canadian government with Americandomination (see Stephen Godfrey  account of how theCanadian Government bent over yet again to the Americansconcerning film distribution, The Globe and Mail  coverstory March 28,1992)  but as well a symptom of the lackof cultural integrity of the country itself.Parallel to this see Deny Arcand's early film on theQuebec referendumAn interesting anecdote - the fate of one Revolutionaryleader---Ch&eacute;nier's heart had been pulled from his body,examined by the British Military doctors...an autopsy hadbeen performed at The Black Bull, a tavern situated in acertain Addison's Hotel in St. Eustache.  They wished todiscover the reason of his death.  He had been shotoutside the Church, falling by the gravestones in theadjoining cemetery.  He had been the chief rebel of theSt. Eustache Patriotes...The official story is that everything was in order.However, war is disorder.  No one can deny that theBritish Government condoned the violent reprisals againstthe Patriote Villages.Why did they need to perform an autopsy?  What kind ofmorbid curiosity demanded this moment of 'medical'intervention?  Was it not plain, that the man died from agunshot wound and leave it at that...The unofficialstory is that his heart was used as a symbol ofderision...that the British doctors yanked his heartfrom his body...that they displayed the heart as an itemof curiosity...that it was carried out in the streets atthe end of a bayonet through the defeated andterror-stricken village...The truth of the matter does not matter, because there isno truth...In the mind of a nation there is onlypositions of power and the myths that prop them up.<HR><center><IMG SRC=que.GIF></center><HR>Power, oppression, war, divisions, displacements,unwieldy and uncomfortable compromise, and translation,the whole cliche mess of this nation's history...When the real is no longer what it use to be, nostalgiaassumes its full meaning. It is here that we suffer the mythology of the present. A present that has never tried so hard to eliminate the subversion and doubt that is the past.  In the contemporary schizophrenic climate the individual mirrors the pulse of a senile opportunism.  The pure allpervading pressure of a loss brilliantly disfigured asthe now.<DD><HR>Our communality is possible in temporal recognitionby the reflection engendered by our singular finality.And so exile and speaking to the deafness of the ocean.<DD><HR>16mm, Broadcast Beta-SP, Colour, 95 minutes, in Frenchand English & subtitled.
