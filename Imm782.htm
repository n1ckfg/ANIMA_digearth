Since they qualitativelyincrease a species possibility of organising and controlling the matter-energy in theirecosystem, their primary characteristic is that of information.  They are forms thatinform; they are informed because they remember the past and make possible new types ofprojections into the future." Anthony Wilden, "System and Structure"</center><P>To suppose that an ecology of communications exists presupposes that there is an evolution tocommunications.   That evolution is substantially one of co-evolution.  Human culture  is a product ofevolutionary strategies.  These primary tools of the human - art making, language, writing, - arethe essential mnemonic mechanisms of human biocultural evolution and ecology.  They arenot only the bees that pollinate the gardens of our minds, but have had and willcontinue to have a symbiotic relationship to the potential uses of our minds ways ofunderstanding.<P>Ecology is not a homeostatic operation but the  complex dynamic ofevolutionary and syncretic potentialities.<P><P><br> <br><IMGSRC="2line.gif"><p><dd><H2><A HREF="0_816.htm">0</A> <A HREF="Skin783.htm">fluidskin</A> <A HREF="1_813.htm">1</A></UL><P ALIGN=center><a href="vol1.htm"><IMGSRC="media/tranbt.gif" border=0></A><p>
