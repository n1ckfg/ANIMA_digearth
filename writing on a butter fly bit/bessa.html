    <p>When I talked to the 
        <a href="Macd.htm">Native Media Artist Mike MacDonald</a> about the odd flight 
        of <a href="binfo.htm">the butterfly</a> he told me it was the creature that he found most 
        difficult to film in flight — he had no problem with birds, 
        <a href="ZAINUB/6.HTML#FROGS" class="broken">other animals</a> or insects — but butterflies were so 
        capricious.
    </p>
    <p>As we seek to articulate solutions to the manifold 
        <a href="noise.htm" class="broken">problems</a> of our times, the delicate and frenetic flight of a butterfly comes 
        to mind. The web of our new capacities, the work of a new fluid way 
        <a href="http://www.obs-us.com/obs/english/papers/butter.htm" class="broken">of writing</a>, of bounding our 
        <a href="eaaco/a.html" class="broken">inscriptions</a> into the water of ideas and images, dissolving our 
        certainty into the living poesis of association, analogy, and an incompleteness that fulfills 
        our need for movement, for the next note, for <a href="0_816.htm" class="broken">the next link</a>.

    <p>The 
        <a href="http://www.jodi.org/">eccentric</a> flight of the butterfly 
        is a parallel of its frailty as a creature. Its unpredictable movement demonstrates a 
        survival strategy of the fantastic.

        "The look forward becomes even more powerful the brighter it becomes aware of itself. 
        The dream in this look becomes quite clear, and the presentiment, being the right one, will
