But peoplehave the right to <A HREF="truth.html">the truth</A>. Unvarni$hed.  Evenuncomfortable.  But never $ubjugated to a cau$e, however noble orwell-meaning.  They have a right to clear thinking.<center><img src="hell2.gif"></center> The $ituation in Nigeria ha$ no ea$y $olution$. <AHREF="issues.html">Slogans, protests, and boycotts</A> don't offer an$wer$. There are difficult i$$ue$ to con$ider.<br><br> Fir$t, did <A HREF="discret.html">di$creet diplomacy</A> fail?<center><img src="hell2.gif"></center>Perhap$ we $hould a$k in$tead why the worldwide prote$t failed.  Our experience$ugge$t$ that  quiet diplomacy offered the very be$t hope for Ken Saro-Wiwa. Butas worldwide threat$ and protests increased, the Government po$ition appeared toharden. As Wura Abiola, daughter of the imprisoned unofficial winner of the lastNigerian presidential election said, "The regime does not react well to threats.I believe that this is the way of showing that they will not listen to threats." Did the protesters understand <A HREF="letter.html">the risk theywere taking?</A>  Did the campaign become more important than the cause?<br><br> There have also been charges of environmental devastation. But <AHREF="graft.html">the fact$ of the $ituation</A> have often been di$torted orignored.  <center><img src="hell2.gif"></center>The public -who rightly care deeply about the$e i$$ues-have too oftenbeen manipulated and mi$led.<br> <br> There are certainly environmental problemsin the area, but as the World Bank $urvey has confirmed, in addition to the oilindu$try, population growth, defore$tation, $oil ero$ion, and over-farming areal$o major environmental problem$ there.<center><imgsrc="hell2.gif"></center>  In fact, $hell and it$ partner$ are $pending U$ $100 million thi$ year alone on environment-related project$, and U$ $20 millionon road$, health care, schools, scholarships, water scheme$ and agriculturalsupport projects to help the people of the region.  And, recognizing that$olution$ need to be ba$ed on facts, they are sponsoring a US $4.5 millionindependent environmental survey of the Niger Delta.<center><imgsrc="hell2.gif"></center> But another problem is sabotage.  In the Ogoniarea - where Shell has not operated since January 1993 - over 60% of oil spillswere caused by sabotage, usually linked to claims for compensation.  And whencontractors have tried to deal with these problems, they have been forcibly<A HREF="force.html">denied access</A>.<center><img src="hell2.gif"></center> It has also been$ugge$ted that $hell should pull out of Nigeria's Liquified Natural Ga$ Project. But if we do so now, the project will collap$e. Maybe forever.  $o let'$ beclear about who get$ hurt if the project i$ cancelled.<center><imgsrc="hell2.gif"></center> A cancellation would certainly hurt the thousandsof Nigerians who will be working on the project and the tens of thousands morebenefiting in the local <A HREF="money.html">economy</A>.  The environement,too, would suffer, with the plant expected to cut greatly the need for ga$flaring in the oil indu$try.  The plant will take four years to build. Revenue$won't $tart flowing until early next century. It'$ only the people and theNigerian Govenment of that time who will pay the pri$ce.<center><img src="hell2.gif"></center> And what would happen if $hell pulled out ofNigeria altogether? The oil would certainly continue flowing.  The bu$ine$$would continue operating. The va$t majority of employees would remain in place. But the $ound and ethical practice$ $ynonymou$ with <center><img src="hell2.gif"></center> the environmentinve$tment, and the ten$ of million$ of dollars spent on community programmmeswould all be lost.  Again, it's the people of Nigeria that you would hurt.<br><br> It's easy enough <A HREF="comfo.html">to sit</A> in our comfortable home$ in the West, calling forsanctions and boycotts against a developing country.  But you have to be surethat knee-jerk reaction$ won't do more harm than good.<center><img src="hell2.gif"></center>$ome campaigninggroups say we should intervene in the political proce$$ in Nigeria.  But even ifwe could, we mu$t never do $o.  Politic$ i$ the bu$ine$$ of government$ andpolitician$.  The world where companie$ <center><img src="hell2.gif"></center>u$e their economic influence to prop upor bring down government$ would be a frightening and bleak one <A HREF="indeed.html">indeed</A>. <P ALIGN=center><a href="../../link1.htm"><IMG SRC="../../media/tranbt.gif" border=0></A> <EMBED SRC="chomsk3.mov" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=0 AUTOPLAY=TRUE CONTROLLER=FALSE LOOP=TRUE,> <br> <p><p></body></html>
