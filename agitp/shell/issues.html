Theywere similarly silent last year, when the oil workers' union was suppressed andits national leaders imprisoned (two of whom remain in custody). In theaftermath of the hanging of the nine Ogoni leaders, there has been no indicationthat the multinational oil producers have contemplated using their economicclout to curb repression.  On the contrary, Shell, Agip, and Elf announced justa few days after the hanging that they would move ahead with a major investmentprogram in Nigeria to compensate for a decision by the World Bank'sInternational Finance Corporation not to do so on human rights grounds.  <br><p><p>
