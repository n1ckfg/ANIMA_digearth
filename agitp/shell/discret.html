OWENS WIWA (Brother of Ken Saro Wiwa)<br> <br>Steering Commitee Member of the Movement for the Survival of the<br>Ogoni People (MOSOP) <br> <br>PREPARED BY GREENPEACE ON BEHALF OF THE MOVEMENT FOR THE SURVIVAL<br>OF THE OGONI PEOPLE<br> <br>VIDEO DURATION: 23 MINS 18 SECS<br>------------------------------- <br> <br>FIRST MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON<br> <br>I first met Brian Anderson the chairman and managing director of<br>Shell Nigeria on the Queens birthday party 1995 in Lagos, and he <br>promises to my wife to help, to see that Ken gets adequate<br>medical attention, he says he will see what he can do and we<br>leave at the end of the party and I write of my encounter to Ken<br>send it through my wife who leaves this day to see Ken and<br>through this letter we are very happy to learn that Ken has been<br>taken to the hospital the military hospital for the first time<br>after being in detention for about 11 months.<br> <br>SECOND MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON<br> <br>Well I asked him if he would use his influence to stop the trial<br>announced so that Ken can get can get out of the illegal<br>detention and so that negotiation can start between Shell and the<br>Ogoni people. And he says that's difficult, but not impossible<br>but that the international campaign is hurting Shell and the<br>Nigerian government and if we can stop the campaign that he might<br>be able to do something.<br> <br>So I tell him that I don't have the power to do that, but however<br>I will pass the information to Ken,  and he also at that time<br>said I should try and get into the press - to get a press release<br>and get him a copy, you know mentioning the fact that there is<br>no environmental devastation in Ogoniland and I just say how<br>can I do that, you mean I tell the world that what we've been<br>saying ever since 1990 is a lie, there is no way I will do that. <br>And that happened at our second meeting.<br> <br>THIRD MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON<br> <br>I wrote to Ken and Ken replied back with a letter to Brian<br>Anderson where he gives him two scenarios. The first one - Ken<br>gets killed and becomes a martyr or they [Shell] did the right<br>thing, use their influence with the Nigerian government and get<br>him out of their illegal detention and stop the charade of the<br>tribunal. And when that happens the lobby with the writers will<br>stop, the lobby by the human rights groups will stop and that<br>remains the environmental campaigners and when the environmental<br>lobby sees that he is now discussing with Shell they will lower<br>or stop their campaign.<br> <br>Mr Brian Anderson tells me that he will no longer be available<br>for further discussion as he'll be travelling frequently but that<br>I should continue the discussion with Mr Achebe.  Mr Achebe <br>stresses the importance of continuous dialogue and after a week<br>I phone Achebe and I'm told he's in Germany I phone again a<br>second time and I'm told he's in Abucja and I phone again and I'm<br>told he's in Port Harcourt holding meetings with other Ogoni<br>people and I phone another time and he's not in the office and<br>all this time I'm leaving my number and my messages and I don't<br>get any reply so I now switch back to phone Anderson both in his<br>office and in his house.  Now I phoned the first time in his<br>house and they tell me he's at a cocktail party I phone another<br>time and he's having lunch and I ask whether I can phone after<br>lunch I don't get any answer, but I still phone and still he's<br>not available and I phone another time and I hear he's not around<br>you know and then I sort if get the message and I write back to<br>Ken that it appears that I'm being avoided and Ken writes back<br>- that I shouldn't bother as it appears a decision has been made.<br> <br>  <br>DEVASTATION OF OGONILAND<br> <br>Ogoni environment is devastated. I got involved in Ogoniland<br>after coming back to Ogoni after my University medical school and<br>then the first thing that struck me is that the trees around my<br>father's house the oranges and the guavas are no longer there the<br>ones there are not producing any fruit and they sort of shrunken.<br>Then I go to the hospital and the spectrum of diseases I see<br>there is quite different from the ones I was taught at school or<br>the ones I saw in other places I'd worked in Nigeria. A lot of<br>respiratory diseases - high incidence of asthma, cancer,<br>bronchitis and I'm quite surprised and also some bizarre skin<br>diseases and a high level of miscarriages which is quite<br>different from other areas in Nigeria that are not producing oil.<br>And the land Ogoni is a small place  about 404 square miles 12<br>miles by 32 and large expanse of land that nothing grows on<br>because of the oil spillages that have happened because of oil<br>blow outs gas flares all over Ogoniland. You don't know when it<br>is night it's always glowing. With the noise from the flow<br>stations - it's very deafening and the people speak rather they<br>shout the way of talking because they have to get across to the<br>other person. And the pipe line gas and oil pipelines cris-<br>crossing the whole place on the surface of the ground passing in<br>front of houses at the back of houses on farm land unprotected. <br> <br> <br>SHELL CLAIM SABOTAGE BY OGONI<br> <br>Shell claims that the environmental devastation in Ogoniland is<br>due to sabotage of the installations by Ogoni people, as far as<br>I know no Ogoni person no MOSOP activist has ever been convicted<br>of sabotage of oil installations. The Ogoni people would be the<br>last people on earth to go near the Shell installations because<br>they know that if anything goes wrong on the pipelines or on the<br>installations it is their land which they hold precious that will<br>be spoiled - that will be devastated it is their streams from<br>which they fish and drink water that will be polluted because<br>their is no piped on water in Ogoniland it's only the water from<br>the streams so no Ogoni person will go near any Shell<br>installation for sabotage because that would lead to spillage and<br>we understand spillages and devastated land more than any people<br>in this world.<br> <br>EVIDENCE THAT SHELL ARE INVOLVED WITH MILITARY<br> <br>I drive down to the village of Korokor-tai when I get there I<br>meet another young man on the ground in a pool of blood at the<br>feet of his mother and I'm told that he was shot by Major<br>[Okuntino??] who had come there in the Shell bus accompanied by<br>Shell executives and they had come to the village, said they were<br>coming to look for Shell trucks. In my clinic in Bori Ogoniland<br>I see the police constable coming to my clinic to tell me that<br>all Ogoni people in the police in Ogoni land have been<br>transferred out and I'm scared and he shows me the posting order<br>transferring them and immediately I get to my car because that's<br>frightening and go to visit my brother in hospital and I tell him<br>what I've just heard and give him the police posting order and<br>he immediately writes on it telling the world about what is<br>happening and he's afraid that the first episode of genocide is<br>being planned against the people, the Ogoni people.<br> <br>I see foreign journalists in Bori and I ask what's happening they<br>said they heard that there's shooting a journalist from the<br>Guardian of London and one from the Independent.  And I take them<br>to the village Kaa where most of my patients come from and we<br>arrive there and it's like a small atomic bomb has been placed<br>on the village I mean dropped on the village, everything the<br>market is completely destroyed, the school the houses even the<br>trees are on the ground and it is very very frightening and we<br>do know this time there were police, I mean a military presence<br>in Ogoniland. They were stationed not too far from my clinic so<br>I go back to the army and ask them what has happened, and we go<br>back there and they see the place and one of the officials says<br>that he hasn't seen this sort of thing even while he was serving<br>in Liberia that no destruction has ever been to this level and<br>in that particular incident 35 people are killed and it continues<br>like that another 7 Ogoni villages are all destroyed and a total<br>of about one thousand people are killed in these raids by people<br>using sophisticated weapons on unarmed villages and my patients<br>tell me that the soldiers arrived across Andoni river with Shell<br>boats  and while all this is going on we notice the presence of<br>Shell helicopters hovering around and we're actually very very<br>worried.<br> <br> <br>DETENTION OF OWENS WIWA<br> <br>On the 26th December 1993 on Boxing day I'm in my house with my<br>wife who's pregnant and her sister as well come to spend<br>Christmas with us and a captain in the Nigerian army Captain<br>Tunde Odina comes in and has a beer in my house and eats the food<br>my wife has prepared and at the end of it he tells me to take a<br>holiday, to leave Ogoniland go to Lagos or somewhere.<br> <br>At about 5 O'clock another Major comes in he calls himself Major<br>Akintola of the Army Intelligence Unit at the Brigade in Bori<br>camp and he tells me that the governor of the state Lieutenant<br>Colonel Komo wants to see me and Barika Idamkue because at this<br>time Barika Idamkue is the secretary of the Ogoni Relief and<br>Rehabilitation Committee and I'm the coordinator so I mean we go<br>there happily thinking that the Governor wants to give some<br>relief to the people so at the end of the conversation I tell him<br>that I was told by a captain, Captain Tunde Odina that I was to<br>be arrested.  So the Governor tells me that is not true that is<br>just one of the rumours that we hear and keep telling people and<br>there's nothing like that so I go back to my house have dinner<br>with my family and go to bed.<br> <br>At about 2am the same captain who had come to my house you know<br>to eat and drink comes in shouting, breaking my door and asks<br>where is Dr Wiwa, I say well I'm here and then the other soldiers<br>climb the fence and generally make noise and then I ask what is<br>the matter and he tells me you are, by the order of the Federal<br>Republic of Nigeria you are under arrest.  So I go back to my<br>room change into my clothes and go into the 504 military vehicle<br>and the other soldiers enter squeeze me in and they take me<br>straight to the country home of Mr Ledum Mitee the Deputy<br>president of MOSOP and repeat the same sort of thing they did in<br>my house and bring the guy into the car and then the soldiers are<br>coming inside too with their guns reeking of alcohol and<br>marijuana and generally threatening us you know, and took us<br>straight to the Air force base in Port Harcourt and later to the<br>house of the government reservation division in Port Harcourt.<br> <br>And we stayed there until the 4th of January at about 5 O'clock<br>or so Major Okuntimo comes in to meet us and to discuss.  We ask<br>him why we are detained he doesn't tell us anything, all he says<br>is he's following his orders and then curiously asks us that<br>since MOSOP is big it's powerful that we should join forces with<br>him you know to see that one Mr Lawson-Jack senior executive of<br>Shell in Port Harcourt is removed and we tell him that we don't<br>do things like that.  We talk about ideas and how to change<br>corporate behaviour in terms of the environmental devastation of<br>Ogoniland we are not in for removing individuals and all that and<br>he insist and so we ask him why, why do you want the man off? <br>and then he explains that the man has been undercutting him in<br>his payments that he was also receiving from Shell.<br> <br>And after our discussion he tells us that we are released and on<br>getting out I meet my mother-in-law and I ask about my wife and<br>she answers that they are fine, I say what do you mean they are<br>fine?  I only have one wife, so she says they are fine that you<br>have a child I said a child ?, she said yes, a son, I said yes<br>how do I know it's a son I said I dreamt you know but then my<br>wife is not due but I rushed down to the hospital that she's<br>supposed to have delivered and I go in there and see her very<br>happy and beside her there's, there's a young kid you know all<br>red and cries when he sees me and I go and pick up my son and I<br>feel very happy and I decide to forget and forgive my detention<br>because that has brought me a son and asked my wife how<br>everything happens and she tells me that after they are taking<br>me away after some hours when daylight was coming she decides to<br>come and look for me.  And at this time there are many roadblocks<br>manned by the army in Ogoniland and she is stopped in one of the<br>roadblocks and she comes out, she is asked to come out of the<br>car, she comes out and they ask her who she is and she tells the<br>person that she's my wife and they say Oh that trouble maker so<br>they ask her to identify herself further , she says she's a<br>housewife and housewives don't carry ID cards. So they<br>search her and they decide to search her person and she doesn't<br>like that and the army man tell her to go into the stream, the<br>stream is polluted covered with oil, my wife doesn't know how to<br>swim.  She protests, she gets the gun, they put up the gun<br>pushing her from the back and she is pushed into the pond, into<br>the stream but because of her hydrophobia she comes out and then<br>the man aims the nozzle of the gun at her pregnant abdomen and<br>then contractions start to come on and that process leads her to<br>the hospital and my baby comes out born on January 4th Ogoni day<br>and that's how I get my child.<br><br>Dr Owens Wiwa<p><p>
