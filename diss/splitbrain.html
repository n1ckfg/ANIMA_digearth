The physical, social and protocultural environment requirments imposed on evolving human gene pools provoked the necessary speciations that granted survival. "<P>"Explicit operations are more subject to hemispheric independence (cerebral segragation) , while implicit operations involve a greater measure of hemispheric interdependence. (cerebral integration)." <P><HR>Nursery Rhymes<HR>The unavoidable balancing act and stochastic process that combine to produce a teleological ecology of variety and stability in the natural world is also seen in the human.<P>"The specter of species-suicide, impossible without the cultural invention of the modern state, speaks loudly for a dramatic qualitive difference between the biological evolution of animal nervous systems and the long-term inclusion of <A HREF="screamandshout.html">unnatural cultural elements</A> into the biological fabric of the evolution of human brains."   <P>The right brain is colonized by the left brainwhich is colonized by languagewhich is colonized by societywhich maintains the status quo.<P><STRONG>"...<A HREF="connectionists.html">cultural adaptations</A>, like all adaptations can and perhaps usually eventually do, <A HREF="technicalimperative.html">become maladaptive</A>,diminishing rather than enhancing the survival chances of organisms bearing them."</STRONG><P>Socialization intrinsically interpenetrates language.  Language is the dominant mode of ideological continuance.  The manipulation of language, the vieling of language, the ownership of language.  Society soft wires its pathological 'stability' into each individual.<P>"Like all images, the self image is mainipulated by language to the extent that its features are verbally and gesturaly communicable.  The sociological-political function of cerebral dominance manipulates one's body-image and one's social image the personality, in concert with reflections from significant others in the ongoing creations of personal identity."
