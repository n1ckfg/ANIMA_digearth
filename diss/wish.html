They are a group ofBuddhist charms, of which no fewer than one million copieswere made and distributed in 770 to various Buddhisttemples by order of the Empress Shotoku.  There isdocumented evidence that printed Buddhist images were madeat a considerably earlier date.<P>From an esotericBuddhist text translated during the T'ang dynasty:"...atthe seashore, or on the bank of a river, one takes an'image seal with the form of a pagoda' and presses it inthe sand once for each time one makes an invocation. After this has been done 600,000 times, one will receive avision of (there follows in the translation here the nameof a somewhat obscure bodhisattva)...and everything thatone desires will come to pass."<P>
