The project envisioned,the application of a montage based approach to navigationand editing, would bring to the digital interactive videorealm an aesthetic level of formal, structural discernmentand flexibility currently unavailable but presentlytechnically feasible.The project: The Majestic Violence of Light is to be thecreative application of the montage based theory approachto the question of <AHREF="mediabasediscussiondoc.html">Mediabase.</A><HR>Conceptual Precis : Synopsis<HR><AHREF="mediabasediscussiondoc.html#hypermedia">Hypermedia</A>confounds with a variable, plastic landscape and ashifting informational horizon.Possibilities in the structuration of interactivehypermedia presents producers and users with inherentinformation <A HREF="one.html#complex">designcomplexities</A> that demand the development of newinterpretive languages and tools.The current standard in CD-ROM and other interactive media(including computer asssisted videodisks) rely uponordering hierarchies that are more often than nottext/menu/file based. These interfaces are predictable andinflexible.  They do not actualize the intricaciesavailable. 'Point and click', hot  text, hypercard, etc.do not allow for an intimacy of interactivity. They givechoices within branching confined contexts but do not giveevidence of the sharing of memory nor do they allow forthe complex application of aesthetic design.What is needed is the elegance of a conversation betweenthe desires, intuitions, and remembrances of the operatorand the material, mediated by the computer, imbedded inthe intricacies of its own syntactical and meaningfulpotentialities - inclusive, necessarily, of the meshbetween database and shared 'user' memory .There are certain and sure conceptual principles that mustformalize the construction of new media tools andlanguages.  Information theory, cybernetics, and montagetheory are the distinct epistemological positions thatallow for an evolving of an effective, ordered, thuslearnable , hypermedia interface.<P>Dimensional levels of order, and the lucid evidence ofgenuine interactivity must be articulated in theaccelerated complexity of the new media.<P>It is in a shared language between program and userthat both the rigor and the imagination of authenticexpressivity can become manifest.<A HREF="screamandshout.html#weiner">Norbert Weiner</A>,one of the foremost mathematician-theorists of thiscentury,  relied on the principles of information theoryto develop cybernetics (the science of maintaining orderwithin a system).  One of the principle tenets ofinformation theory is that an isolated piece of data hasno meaning.  The creation of meaning is relational and situational. Like all great intellectual 'discoveries' <AHREF="Innovation.html">this is obvious</A> and profound inthe same instant.<P>The science of cybernetics and of information alsoguides the formation of meaning and order in film andvideo construction.  It is in the relationship (themontage ) between one shot and another shot, between onescene and another scene (a scene is normally composed ofnumerous shots) that allows a viewer to understand themeanings implied by the author.<P>"Among all the art forms that can teach us aboutcommunication, the most appropriate is filmmaking. Itillustrates the transition from an engineering disciplineto an art form." Heckel goes on to observe that movies didnot achieve wide popular success until artists replacedengineers as the primary creators.   Paul Heckel, TheElements of <A HREF="screamandshout.html">FriendlySoftware</A> Design, 1982.<P>Through the course of the 100 years of cinema's historyfilmmakers and theorists have been thinking,experimenting, and writing about what the juncturesbetween shots and sequences signify. There is presently awealth of knowledge regarding the semiotics of film visualand audio editing that can be used to help define arelational data base for the digital domain of hypermedia.<P>A language of editing possibilities can be constructed. The results would be a multipurpose database in which tonavigate within hypermedia.  It would also haveimplications as an intelligent splicer tool fordemonstrating edit choices in traditional (linear) videoor film in a post production setting.<TT><P>A descriptive model: synthetic cinema - a computerbased approach to the construction of interactive cinema. A movie is parsed into component plot points, aestheticjunctures,  and narrative moves that are reconstructedinto various contiguous combinations as a function of userinput, and the computer subsequently responds relative tovarious rhetoric rules that it has been assigned tofollow.</TT><P>User input is recollected by the computer as an aspectof user intention. Intention is defined in the context ofconstructive language skills applied by the user . <HR><TT>Conclusions: </TT><HR> Hypermedia presents afrustrating and incoherent complexity and overload ofdiscrete elements that need to be structured inaccessible, enjoyable, and meaningful form. Montage theorycan be applied to create a relational data base for thepurposes of navigation in hypermedia.<P>Interactivity is based on the creative mesh of sharedlanguage. Language is inherently ordered.  Montage is thelanguage of cinema/audiovisual media. The codes thatmediate interactivity are variations on the theme ofredundancy and novelty. These codes can be mixed, playedupon, and combined to create personal codes. Thus developsthe language and the specificity's of interactivity.<P>Meaning and imagination become the context forinteraction.<HR><BR> <I><H4><ahref="mailto:hereticfilms@shaw.ca">hereticfilms@shaw.ca</a></I><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY></HTML>
