According to the Vice-Chancellorof Cambridge University (1644) John Lightfoot : " Man was created by the Trinity about the third hour of the day, or nine o'clock in the morning in the year now identified as 3928 B.C."    Six years later Archbishop James Ursher did his own calculation and stated that the beginning of time fell upon the night before the twenty-third day of October in the year of the Julian calendar 710 which is 4004 B.C.
