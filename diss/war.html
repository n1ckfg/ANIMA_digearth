Theexercise of power by the state is a permanent conspiracy, which marks the stages of the military revolution, thepassage from the fragmentary and unsophisticatedproduction of the war enterprise to its technological,industrial and scientific development. The historicaleffort of the west is thus the distribution and managementof independent,increasingly numerous human groups by thestate war machine."  Paul Virilio<P> <AHREF="progress.html">Progress</A> as nothing more thantechnological gimcrackeries of one sort or another.<P>Reason as no more than the instruction forapplications.  <P>The psyche as a mechanism to beconditioned to proper functionings within thetechnological state.  <P>A kind of slavery to productiveefficiency to a machine that rotates upon the samespot...without thought...<P>The central application is theconfinement of the imagination and the suppression andperversion of the drive to ecstasy.  <P>World as warmachine. <P>The production of speed and the whitespinclatter of political patch work.  <P>The technologicaladventure personified as the goal of control andadvantage.  <P>Control over the space of the earth andadvantage over Time itself. <A NAME=Virilio iscorrect><H3>Virilio is correct: All of us are alreadycivilian soldiers.  </H3></A>We don't recognize themilitarized part of (our) identity, of (our)consciousness."  <P>And anyway, what is so dangerous aboutthe Mohawks, about the sovereignty claims of the FirstNations?  Virilio states that the war machine is thecrystallization of science as the <AHREF="splitbrain.html">language</A> of power, of thedepletion of the energies of society, and their drainingaway into the war machine.  Maybe this is what is sothreatening about the struggles of the First Nations.  Itviolates and refuses the genetic logic of thetechnological dynamo." Arthur Kroker, The PossessedIndividual.<P>The disappearance of place replaced by thesimulations of the screen. The eternalizing heaven of thesimulacrum.<P><H3><A HREF="chiapas.html">Think ofChiapas</A>...</H3>  With the instigation of the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement Mexico has been gearing it'seconomy to suit the interests of International capitalism. The reforms of past decades have been rolled back. Citizens of sovereign states are really only of use ifthey can be of use tothe global economy; read this to meanthe technological imperiatives of ever increasing speedand dislocation. Land based societies are the obviousbarricade.Dislodged from their ancestral homes, theaboriginals revolt against their 'international'overlords.  ----<P>Total war as the creation of the totalwork of art. The punks were right, there is no futurethough there is a repeat broadcast. Sanitized andaesthetically pure and unadulterated perfect kills.  <P>Ontarget.  <P>Already available the Gulf War as ainteractive video game.  Television feeding  puerilefascination with the technical wonder of the machinationsof destruction, <P>While withholding the smell of thecorpses.  <P>We become disembodied.  <P>We watch from onfar. Much like the interest one may have in hockey cards:the statistics, diagrams, and witty authoritarianmonologues of our power to examine at our leisure <P>- war as  spectator sport - <P>We of the industrial world thepowerful gods who can rain destruction from the comfort ofour Eze boy chairs.  <P>The joy stick of the westerndemocracies Has become encrusted with the blood of itswonderful freedom From responsibilities.
