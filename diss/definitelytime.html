The wealth of the community is simply being channeled into the hands of <A HREF="chiapas.html">already wealthy individuals, corporations, and corrupt institutions.  </A>A financial aristocracy rules the country.  Individuals like Conrad Black.  Born with the silver spoon, yet acting as if a self-made man, perpetuating the myth of the democratic nature of pure capitalism.     20% of Canada's population owns 70% of the wealth of the country.   The poor (almost all the artists of course) that's 20% of the population, owns -0.3 % of the wealth.  That's minus 0 point 3 per cent of the wealth. The struggling poor (the next 20%) owns about 2.4% of the wealth.  The lower and upper middle class owns about 30% (Statscan.) <P>"You saw what's common, that which happens all the time.But we are asking for:That which is not alien, find it strange!That which is common, find it inexplicable!What is usual should amaze you.What is the rule recognize as misuseAnd where you find misuseTake remedial measures!" <I>Brecht, The Exception and the Rule </I>So, by the by, what are you, you, the well-paid middle managers, tenured academics, and well off intellectual worker going to do about this obvious disparity ?  (Not to mention the needs that must be addressed of the exploited elsewhere in the world?)It is definitely time to put your money where your mouth, - or at least where your mouth use to be.  It's time you came up with strategies to spread the wealth around...job sharing would be in order for example, as would early 'retirement'.  </PRE>
