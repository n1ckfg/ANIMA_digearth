Watson and Francis Cricksuggested in their model of DNA that the program forgenerating life was stored in a pattern of nucleic acids. More important, this view has been recently expanded byexperts in systems theory, information theory,cybernetics, and modern theoretical physics to apply toall activities in the universe.  The area of scientificstudy that has most substantively validated the claim thatthe human brain is an information processing system isneuroscience.  The following comments by advocates of thehypothesis illustrate the extent to which theirunderstanding of the character of evolution legislatesover their view of AI technologies inexorable progressinto existence as conscious beings.  <P>According to JohnKemeny, inventor of the programming language BASIC, whatwe will witness in the initial stages of the AI Revolutionis a <I>"symbiotic union of two living species,"</I>ourselves and AI computer systems, and <I>"each will bedependent on the other for survival."</I>  <I>When amachine with the average intelligence of a human beingcomes into existence,</I> says Marvin Minsky, a pioneerand leading exponent of research in artificialintelligence at MIT, it <I> "will begin to educateitself... in a few months it will be at the geniuslevel... a few months after that its power will beincalculable."</I> <P>When we look into <AHREF="technicalimperative.html">the more distantfuture</A>, according to physicist Robert Jastrow, we areobliged to come to an even more dramatic conclusion;<I>"The era of carbon-chemistry life is drawing to a close onearth and a new era of silicon-based life -indestructible, immortal, infinitely expendable - isbeginning." ...</I><P>There are, of course, many reputable AIexperts who do not endorse the AIevolution-of-consciousness hypothesis, and who regardthose who do as extremists.  Although it might be temptingto dismiss the hypothesis by appealing to the authority ofthe experts, those who are concerned about the potentialnegative impacts of future AI systems on human life andconsciousness should, in my view, resist this impulse. The first reason for doing so is that these allegedextremists have <A HREF="wrong.html">enormousreputations</A> in AI research, and their advocacy of thehypothesis is anything but casual.  ... If they succeed intheir efforts to make the hypothesis an orthodox view inthe AI community, which is clearly their intent, then theconsequences could be graver that most of us could beginto imagine.  If the planners and developers of AI systemscome to view these systems as stages in an evolutionaryprocess that is inexorably leading to the creation ofconscious beings that will be superior to ourselves, it isreasonable to assume that they will not be terriblypreoccupied with the potential negative impacts onourselves." - Nadeau</PRE>
