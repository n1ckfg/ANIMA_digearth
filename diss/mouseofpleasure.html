What could one expect? When the human has abdicated to its own machinery, when codebecomes more important than meaning, when all place is same place?<P>A nodding acquaintance with death exists in these somnambulists that surround me and that are me. There is the occasional acknowledgment, vague prescience of moments in a dream time that neitherhas any control over.   This is the primary tyranny, the one that cannot be finished with, the one that we hear most clearly in the language of pain and the blunt cry of infants.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY></HTML>
