In a world in which events do not take place in a conveniently serial fashion, the human brain is adept at dealing with a vast number of separate objects and processes in parallel.  Pioneers in parallel processing who to refer to themselves as "connectionists", are rapidly developing computer systems designed to solve problems that are irregular, unpredictable, and governed by rules that are not universal.  Inspired by the brain's neural network, the connectionists emphasize massive parallelism, distributed information storage, and associative interconnections.(At least fifty major research efforts in this country (the U.S.) alone are dedicated to building new parallel computer systems...")Nadeau.<P>Read Nadeau
