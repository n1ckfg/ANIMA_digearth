<H2>Brilliant Innovation Taken For Granted</H2>"The solutions of problems are not "invented" or "deduced" they are "found"; they "occur".  Because <I>post factum</I> the previously separate mental fields merge into one and the jagged bisociative act is smoothed out into a now continuous associative flow, all revolutionary innovations appear after a while as trivialand obvious, and we marvel less at the discovery itsef, than at the apparently abysmal stupidity of the mental stage preceding it..."<I><P>Arthur Koestler, "Insight and Outlook", New York: Macmillan, 1949.</I><H2>There Are Revolutions</H2>"A new science arises out of one that has reached a dead end.Often <A HREF="chiapas.html">a revolution</A> has an interdisciplinary character-its centraldiscoveries often come from people straying outside the normal bounds of their specialties.  The problems that obsess these theorists are not recognized as legitimate lines of inquiry." <P><I>James Glick, "Chaos", Penguin, 1987.</I>
