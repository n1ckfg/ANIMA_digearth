It knocks in all that happens, with its shortest time span, and it knocks on the door.  But not every present opens up for it. The actual impulses, the socially driving pulses, do not knock in each present, fresh and vital, and human.  Not every time opens up for the now and the next now that stands exactly at that moment in front of the door and that has never 'entered' before.  It has not uploaded its true contents with which and toward which it is on its way.  These contents, the complexities of tomorrow, the magic and fantasy of the impossible made possible, have not come yet, other than in fragments, at best in installments of a more evolved existence.   <P>The promise of the perfect remains around the corner beckoning, haloed, in seductive technological jargon a camouflage for its hostile, virulent virus.<P>An acquaintance of mine had a dream the other night.  She found on her kitchen table, amongst the bread crumbs, what looked like a thin black plastic square,...  she was strangely attracted to the object...it did not occur to her to question the purpose of the object, it was in it's oblique unanswerable<P>- like the future perhaps.  <P>She inserted the object in her vagina using it to masturbate withhowever it seemed to her that the object gave out a cry as she came...Of course this object must have been a future life form infiltrating the dream dimensional plane of the earthly sphere,...who knows...and who knows how many humans it had sex with that night and what kind of prodigy it predicted with its action...but notice its somnambulist resemblance to a floppy disk...a thin plastic square.  <P>We willno doubt see the development of substrates upon which the switches of the digital will intersect directly with the human nervous system. After all that prospect is the expectation of some of the most highly placed artificial intelligent (sic) experts.  According to famed physicist and computer geek Robert Jastrow, we are obliged to come to recognize that; <P>"The era of carbon-chemistry life is drawing to a close on earth and a new era of silicon-based life - indestructible, immortal, infinitely expendable - is beginning." ...<P>thanks, Ernst Bloch.<P>
