<blockquote><H4>Towards The Discrete</H4>

<Hr><TT>No Boundaries<hr> <TT>"There are no boundaries in
things.  Laws try to impose some, and the mind cannot bear
it."- Pascal, Mathematician and philosopher
(b.1623-d.1662) <P> In the <A
HREF="innovation.html">intercourse</A> between <A
HREF="Syntacticaltools.html">applied aesthetics</A> and a
thorough admittance of the <A
HREF="yeshello-1.html">mnemonic</A> and morphic
essentialism of digital tools, exists <A
HREF="Idealworldfire.html">the Ideal</A>.<P>Though the
Ideal is <A HREF="screamandshout.html">not necessarily
conducive to the human</A> it is the predicted realm of
our intentionality.  It is the Platonic model upon which
lower forms come into existence in envious simulation.

It is the state of the non-dead, the non-human, the
faultless and stringently abstract.<P>Constantly
entertained and illuminated by its own brilliance, it is
the hallucinated inscriptions of our wish.  So linked <A
HREF="repetition.html">to desire</A>, it is Janus like,
Eros and Thanatos combined in a rhythm of vain
artificiality that defines an always coming into being. As
such it is monstrous in its adaptability, its aptitude to
transmigrate, to transform itself into something else.  A
something else that is yet, only a facet of its basic
impossibility - stainless, uncorrupted, ageless, without
substance. <Hr>Hermeneutical Bits<Hr> "Multiplicity<A
HREF="mediabasediscussiondoc.#associative"></A> which is
not reduced to unity is confusion. Unity which does not
depend on multiplicity is tyranny."- Pascal

<P>Hysterically definitive, thoroughly logical, repeated
chants of Zeros' and Ones' gives you any number of numbers
to a practical infinity of mathematically seasonable
strawberry fields. The binary diffuses an exactitude of
similitude, rains an illusion of perfectitude through
continual electronic switches allowing and disallowing, in
algorithmic procedural commands. <Hr>There Is No God But
God<Hr> <A HREF="limit.html">So, what does this
reflect</A> but the successes of an inhuman patience, an
Alhabraic monotony of <A
NAME="one.html#complex">labyrinthine design</A>.  Moslem
culture with its violence against representations and
appreciation of <A HREF="wish.html">repetitive</A>
abstraction finds a home in your hard drive.   There is no
God but God.

<A HREF="War.html#Virilio is correct">Terminal
language.</A>

Program Language.

<P>The adjustable face of grammar, the originating  of
human intelligence replaced by the nervous excitation of
an expecting, silicon mask.  An immaculate mask of
distinct memory, but no resemblances. <Hr>Und So Weiter Or
And So On<Hr> To be like the capacity of each wave of the
ocean remembering every other wave of the ocean that has
ever been.<P> The essential fluidity of digital discourse
insists upon a massive turning of attention upon the
tongue, the language, the intercourse, between programs.
<P>What program are you watching? What program is watching
you? What program are you acting in?

<P>In the theoretical asanas of structuralism,
deconstruction, and in information theory, where analysis
is reflexive, where meta codes configure the plastic
operants of creativity, the hands of differance meet, tied
and bound to a new and improved uncertainty.

<P>These contents, the complexities of tomorrow, the magic
and fantasy of the impossible made possible, have not come
yet, other than in fragments, at best in installments of a
more integrative existence and pushed up against the wall,
we are violated by a promise of our  own making. All
heavens, all arabian nights, all mirror palaces, and
bright blue flowers, ice crystal castles and luminous
landscapes and mythical animals who lay down with one
another in peace and harmony.


<P>The promise of the perfect thursts a  hollow shaft of
impregnable light  and in whispered seductive
technological jargon, camouflages  its hostile, virulent
virus.

<Hr>Or <A HREF="fantasticutopiansex.html">The Art Of
Entering Anothers Body</A><Hr> Telecommunication will
become the primary heuristic information sphere, source,
re-source, gallery/studio of <A
HREF="mediabasediscussiondoc.html">new media</A> art and
art inter-activity  of the postmodern multicultural
social.<P>Interpenetrating hard core experimentalism in
informatics/<A
HREF="mediabasediscussiondoc.html#hypermedia">hypermedia</A>
telecommunications depends upon a reliance on the formal
qualities of the coding and interface design. It is
through the reflections engendered by an immersion in the
property of encoding, and of memory, that the structure of
future developments rests. <Hr>Memory Theatre<hr> Mutual
illumination, parallelisms, perpetual syncronicity. 
Everything has a meaning. <P>And you'd better listen up!
(One of the greatest somnabulists, the prophetess of
Prevost, said in pronouncements edited by Justinus Kerner
in the early part of the nineteenth century, "The world is
a circle for me.  In this circle I could go forwards and
backwards and see what there had been and what was to
come.")

To predict and predicate the emerging paradoxical function
of global telecommunications as transient loci and central
medium of cultural advocacy, exchange, and change we need
to create an experimental station.  It needs to be a 
rapaciously interdisciplinary critical area for the
application of the association of informational design and
communications. <P><A HREF="Iamdreaming.html">This gate
way</A> is to embody a futuristic reading of implications
and scenarios of the digital realm for the creation of art
and the dissemination of the cultural .

<Hr>Everywhere and Nowhere<Hr> The Idea's radiation <A
HREF="mouseofpleasure.html">in the finite</A> through the
online. <P>To translate from the gestures of the user,
commands, to the cup runneth over of the informational
epiphany is the desired art. <P>What is it that you want
to know when everything known is waiting to be downloaded?
How will you speak to a cacophony? <Hr>Even Among Dragons
There Are Nine Varieties<Hr> (Han Chinese folk expression)
<P>No matter -- even bottled in its binary transforms,
change is always, and only, a recognition of difference. 
This, the attributes of every system or program is,
ultimately, the translations of metaphors inscribed from
our own minds likeness.  They are the graven images of our
ideologies, they are the icons of our Gods, they are the
banalities of our realities, and they are the unknowns of
our fears and ecstasies. <P>However the specialization
required to maintain position within the current
competitive/slave environment posits a narrowing of
horizons. A greater and greater dependence upon
instrumental reason creates <A
HREF="definitelytime.html">an elite</A> that is
irresponsible to the idea of a common culture.The
overriding tendency is loss. Loss of cultural value and of
value itself.

For when everything has become a measure of something
else, whether it be information or economic exchange, the
remembrances of the individual, the basis of their
sympathetic relation with the world, is forgotten,
disallowed. The result in art and culture is the turning
of the linearity of quest and the articulation of meaning
into the uroboros of solipsism, pastiche, and
appropriations, -<A HREF="War.html#culture"> history is
liquefied</A>, but there is really nothing left to drink.
<Hr>Dogs Are To Humans<Hr> "The elite who occupy the
commanding heights of digital reality are suicidal
nihilists. Suicidal nihilists know that there is no longer
any substantive purpose to their willing.  But they would
always prefer to go on willing than not to act at all. 
They can very happily ally themselves with a notion of
nuclear holocaust or perfect exterminism....They're
creating again and again the exterminism of human memory,
the exterminism of human sensibility, the exterminism of
individuated human intelligence, <A HREF="grave.html">the
exterminism of human morality </A>itself." - Arthur Kroker
in Mondo 2000, Issue #11. 1994

<P>Claude Shannon, widely recognized as one of the
principal architects of modern electronic communications,
sees "no limits to the capacities of thinking machines,"
and "can visualize a time in the future when we persons
will be to computers <A HREF="screamandshout.html"> as
dogs are to humans</A>".

<P>When information ceases its active role and when its
coherence breaks down, the organism enters into a state of
decay and breaks up into a mere collection of inanimate
components.  Please extrapolate from the above...

<H3><TT>The active role of communication is the
connectivity and unison of the community of
communities...the prerogative of cultural production.
</TT></H3> <Hr>But Still The Problem of Souls<Hr> <A
HREF="repetition.html">Meaning goes back to a root that
signifies 'opinio' or 'intention' and is closely related
to the word moaning.</A>

<P>An endless system of deferrals transpires between these
social and individual meanings and the imposing reality of
biological wants that they of necessity hinge upon, within
the psychological, evolutionary, yet ephemeral self .  It
is here where <A HREF="splitbrain.html">power</A> and
politics, evoked by will, becomes the primary determinate,
over and above the nicety of a usefully applied
conceptual.

Politics, to quote the Canadian Revolutionary William Lyon
Mackenzie, "is the science that teaches the people of a
country to care for each other." (1836)
