I did not leave until about 1pm. I returnat about eight and, as I am heading to the building, I see Loser up onthe second floor. Yep, he's heading back to the "palace." As I walk in,I already hear Loser pacing around. Tonight it appears to be the circularpattern. No doubt, being by himself at the "palace" is driving him crazy.Maybe he should get "stooge" to live with him! All is quiet until ... aknock! It is "stooge." Loser has been waiting all night for "stooge" tocome by. He is ecstatic. But, wait! "Stooge" is not staying. Poor Loser.My mistake, "stooge" has come back. They walk around for a long time, andfinally they sit down. All the while Loser is doing all the talking. Losermust be a wealth of knowledge. No wonder "stooge" pays homage to him. So,an hour of walking around the "palace" and assorted drumming of the "palace"f for 20 minutes.Is that Loser singing or is that his K-Mart all-in-one entertainment center?It's hard to say. It's two in the morning, I'd say he was singing. Giveit a rest already! Who does Loser think he is? David Hasselhoff?<P>Traversing the "palace" is now up to thirty minutes and counting. Ifonly he knew that the whole world now knows what he does up there. Hisexciting life is on the Internet! Time for a whiz! Maybe that is why Loserwas pacing around for over 40 minutes. His bladder needed to be unloaded,but that is very difficult when one is excited by visions of "stooge."Well, anyway, that is a good sign because after his whiz, it is usuallynight-night for Loser. Wait! What is that noise in the background? Soundslike a printer. It is Loser's computer. Loser must be working on a projectwith the "stooges." The "stooges" were probably pulling the all-nighterwith Loser that one time because Loser has the computer. Now they justlet Loser do all the work for them. And he even rented that movie. Whois the real stooge?</tt></blockquote></td></tr><tr>	<td><img src="media/spacer_550.gif" width=550 height=8 hspace="4" border="0"></td></tr><tr>    <td width="100%" align="center" valign="bottom"><img src="media/footer.gif" width=550 height=28 border="0"></td></tr></table></body></html>
