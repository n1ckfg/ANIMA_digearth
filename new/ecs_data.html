I did not leave until about 1pm. I returnat about eight and, as I am heading to the building, I see Loser up onthe second floor. Yep, he's heading back to the "palace." As I walk in,I anting. Ifonly he knew that the whole world now knows what he does up there. Hisexciting life is on the Internet! Time for a whiz! Maybe that is why Loserwas pacing around for over 40 minutes. His bladder needed to be unloaded,but that is very difficult when one is excited by visions of "stooge."Well, anyway, that is a good sign because after his whiz, it is usuallynight-night for Loser. Wait! What is that noise in the background? Soundslike a printer. It is Loser's computer. Loser must be working on a projectwith the "stooges." The "stooges" were probably pulling the all-nighterwith Loser that one time because Loser has the computer. Now they justlet Loser do all the work for them. And he even rented that movie. Whois the real stooge?</tt></blockquote></td></tr><tr>	<td><img src="media/spacer_550.gif" width=550 height=8 hspace="4" border="0"></td></tr><tr>    <td width="100%" align="center" valign="bottom"><img src="media/footer.gif" width=550 height=28 border="0"></td></tr></table></body></html>
