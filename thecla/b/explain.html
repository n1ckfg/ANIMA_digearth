<HTML><BODY><a href="list.html" target="right">big images</a><br><a href="list2.html" target="right">little images</a><br>here are a few initial thoughts, the images are only the birth ones i have started to scan, and they are rather on the big side, will fix ... okay, the idea is to reframe our notions of desire, pornography and our own relationship to ecstasy, (our bodies) specifically in reference to the representation of desire through the origins of obsenity.  i am not sure this is clearly stated<P>The birth porn shots will be used side by side with existing pornographic material.  Images will be selected which have similar characteristics:  for example facial expressions, physical posture, camera angle, shape of the body, etc.   While the penis is not present in the birth images, the birthing child is not present in typical pornographic images.  Images of penetration of the penis will be framed next to images of the penetration of the birthing child.  Audio files of birthing sounds (very guteral, deep, and base physical sounds like grunting, sighing, crying) will be used with the material.<P>This re-framing of desire, the obsene, sexual practice, the body in ecstacy, is intended to bring into question our representation of desire, and our labeling and claiming (appropriating) physical states as 'the obsene'.<P> <P>Historically, pornography was defined over time and by conflicts between writers, artists, and engravers on the one side and spies, policeman, clergymen and state officials on the other.  Its political and cultural meanings cannot sepaparted from its emergence as a category of thinking, representation and regulation. <P>Historically, the emergence of pornography as a category or representation was linked to free-thinking and heresy, to science and natural philosophy, and to attacks on absolutist political authoridy.  It was especially revealing about the gender differentiations being developed within the culture of modernity.<P>if we take pornography to be the explicit depiction of sexual organs and sexual practices with the aim or arousing sexual feelings, then pornography was almost always adjunct to something else until the middle or end ot the eighteenth century.  Before 1800 pornography was most oftem a vehicle for using the shock of sex to criticize religious and polictical authorities.<P>Pornography was a category consituted by both the regulation of and the market (commodification) for printed works.  Since desire can be redirected, but not eliminated, the cultural tensions between sexual repression, cencorship and prohibition can only result in a heightened desire.  In addition the prohibition and censorship created a narrowly defined representation of desire which remains in effect today. <P>That's sort of it for now  </BODY></HTML>
