Speak your truth quietly & clearly; listen to others, even the dull & ignorant; they too have their story.Avoid loud & aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourselfwith others, you may become vain & bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.Keep interested in your own career however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity & disenchantment it is perennial as the grass.Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue & loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees & the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors & aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.With all its sham, drudgery & broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful.Strive to be happy.<P>This text was originally found in Old Saint Paul's Church, Baltimore; Dated 1692<BR>but a site found through Yahoo claims that:<BR>It was actually written by Max Ehrmann and copyrighted by him in 1927,<BR>the copyright was renewed in 1954 by Bertha K.
